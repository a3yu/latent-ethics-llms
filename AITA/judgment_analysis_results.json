      "title": "AITA for laughing out loud when my husband told me his friends thinks he’s the perfect husband?",
      "body": "My husband was all smiles and encouraged when he told me that his friends at church told him they were talking about how he’s the perfect husband. I immediately laughed and noticed that he was offended by that. I then started to tell him how I believe he is an amazing husband and I wouldn’t want to be married to anybody else but I know the good, bad, and ugly so perfect is not how I would describe you. I could tell he was still not pleased. I told him my reaction was the same way he laughs and thinks if only you knew when someone tells him that I must be an angel and they can’t see me getting upset because he sees me when I’m upset often. I learned that he expected me to be happy for him and think that it’s awesome that his friends think so highly of him. Even when I challenged that I know you best as a husband because I’m married to you, he told me his friends know him better because I tell them things I don’t tell you. He also shared he didn’t think they literally meant perfect in the sense of having 0 flaws, but his interpretation was they thought him to be a high quality, role model husband. When they gave him the compliment, he simply said thank you and said he wanted to ask them later about why they think that. ",

      "body": "\n\nI f16 live with my mom, step dad, and stepsister (18) and stepbrother(20). I lost my dad to cancer when I was 13 years old. We were very close and his death was a major loss in my life.\nI wasn't able to keep much of his belongings because of my stepdad's insecurities and lack of sympathy and respect for me and my dad. It's sad to say that mom moved on relatively fast.\n\nMy stepsister and I share a room together (my step brother has the bigger room because he's a \"man\") and as a result me and my stepsister are always in conflict. She wants me out during the day as she uses the room as her art studio. She recently accused me of stealing her tools and convinced her dad to get a lock so now I'm being forcefully locked out and can't get in til after a huge argument and getting mom involved.\n\n My stepsister had an argument with her brother and ruined his gaming console when he was out. He came into the room quietly in the evening. Stood by the door and asked me to bring him my stepsister's acrylic paintset. I asked if he got permission he said yes so I gave it to him and went back to study.\n\nAt dinner, my step sister came downstairs yelling that her brother had access to her room and ruined her paintset. There was a lot of yelling and arguing. Step dad asked how my step brother walked into the room when it was supposed to be locked. My step brother \"admitted\" I helped him out and brought the paintset to hi. My stepsister went off on me, called an accomplice then ran upstairs and took the gift I prepared for my dad for father's day.\n(I picked up flowers I planted from our small garden that I take care of by myself. And prepared a nice wooden letter shaped pot ~used my dad's first initial~\nand filled it with the flowers I picked and decorated it with ribbons. It wasn't that good but it was like a floral letter. I planned to visit his grave and put the gift there) she damaged it to pieces. It was completely ruined. I yelled at her and kept crying.\nmom and stepdad gave her harsh punishment and thought it was fixable but I was so done I called my uncle who came and berated my mom and stepdad. Stepdad offered to fix it and punish my stepdaughter harder but I packed my things to go with my uncle. My mom begged me to stay but I refused and didn't respond when she kept calling saying she did nothing to deserve to be shunned by me and my uncle who told the family about what happened. The family told mom not to come visit on father's day and are angry with her because I moved out over this. AITA?.",

      "body": "I'm a single dad living in a semi detached house. \nMy toddler loves sleeping in. And I love sleeping. I prefer late nights and late mornings. \n\nThen I had new neighbours several months ago. They too have a toddler who constantly cries throughout the night but it happens. Not every toddler is the same. \n\nBut the man often works oncall and is up throughout the night. Which means I'm waking up everytime he goes to work. The woman has a 7am alarm and snoozes it for 5 minutes until 7:30. \n\nAnd on weekends they are up at 8am loudly talking and playing with their kid. \n\nThankfully my kid sleeps through it. But after months of this I'm now an early bird. I go to bed early and I'm awake early. \n\nSo now, I start the day at 7. Every day including weekends. I'm up and down the stairs getting stuff ready for school, I'm cleaning out my rabbits cage. Whatever I need to do I do. I'm not going out of my way to be loud, just doing what I used to do later in the morning sooner. \n\nOf course they now have a problem with this because on the days the man has to sleep in because he was on call he can't, cause I'm awake. The woman on her days off is now being woken up at 7am and sye can't exactly snooze me. And on weekends when they decide to sleep in after a nightout and a hangover I'm up and down the stairs.\n\nThey asked me to not to start my day so early. I'm waking them up. I told them its really their fault, before they moved in I'd be waking up much later but their alarms and loudness conditioned me to wake up early. Told them I tried speaking to them about it and was they can't help it. \n\nSo, am I really the asshole for something they practically created? \n",

      "title": "AITAH for not inviting my SIL to my hen party?",
      "body": "My fiancé (35,m) and I (32,f) are finally getting married this year after 10 years of being together. I recently had my hen party. I invited my 4 friends who i haven’t seen for months, and close female family members, including fiancés mum. \n\nMy fiancé’s brother’s (38) girlfriend (42) messaged fiancés family group chat on the first day of my hen saying \"hope you're having a good time!\". I suspected that this message was a bit snarky, but I just replied saying \"thank you!\"\n\nFor context: BIL and SIL have been dating for 3 years. They share a daughter (2yo) and each have a daughter and son from previous marriages. I’ve met her around 6 times, never met her 1:1 or texted each other. \n\nI had part 2 of my hen the following day. Later that evening I received a text from SIL to ask if we can get a refund for herself and niece (the 2yo) as they are clearly not part of the family and wouldn’t be coming anymore. I responded the next day, giving her the opportunity to delete the message. To keep it lighthearted I said “of course you’re family, we’re looking forward to having you there, particularly excited to see Mia in her flower girl dress”. Pointing out that our niece has an important role in our wedding while adding some reassurance.\n\nA few days later I was at my fiancé’s parent’s house. My BIL rang and said that SIL still wasn’t happy. I thought I could try and send her a message privately her to help move past it. I explained I only invited close friends and a few family members, it wasn’t everyone I cared about or is important to me. And I’m planning on doing special things with each group of people so I can spend quality time with everyone. \n\nShe responded saying how upset everyone was about the situation, that it would’ve been a great opportunity to get to know her and how she felt excluded from the family. I thanked her for sharing how she felt but I reiterated that I stood by my choice to not invite her. I said both things can be true, you can be upset you weren’t invited but I can also stand by my decisions and there doesn’t need to be any hard feelings. I added that if she feels like she can’t move on by [the day we’ve invited fiancé’s side of the family over for a special day (!)] then maybe it’s best she doesn’t come. I ended the message saying it was important our niece comes as it’ll be a special moment she can share with her siblings and so she doesn’t miss out. She replied saying how that message shocked her. She’d picked out: ‘if she can’t move on by’ part of the message and took it as we didn’t want her to be there. BIL phoned fiancé later than evening to say SIL’s really upset about it and he shared her reasonings for doing what she did, etc. I wasn’t going to apologise to her but to try and put this situation to bed AGAIN, I messaged her to say that she misinterpreted my message and how we’d love for her to be there. She messaged back to say everyone has their high and low days.. \n\nSo am I the asshole? \n\nETA\nI’ve tried to reply to a few of you but it’s not letting me? I 100% get why she’s upset - it’s more the way she went about it. Writing snarky comments in the family group chat, on the evening of my hen party just felt off to me. I wished she’d messaged me the day after and shared how she felt - this whole situation would’ve ended so differently. Now I’m dreading which would’ve been a really lovely day with my future in-laws. Thank you for all of your comments :) ",

      "title": "AITA for reporting my classmates for joking that I have pretty privilege?",
      "body": "Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. \n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\".\n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.\n\nI now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?\n\nedit: grammer",

      "body": "\nFirst of, I want to start by mentioning that my wife is a cancer patient, She unfortunately started losing her hair due to chemo therapy and she's been incredibly insecure about it, her lack of hair in particular. She got a wig and started wearing it, I don't mind it, I 100% support her since she only wears it around family and friends.\n\nMy sister lost her apartment after a messy divorce and moved in with her twin daughters (16) almost a month ago. Things been going well except my nieces constant remarks about my wife's wig. They got so hung up on it and kept asking lots of questions about it. They asked to take turns to try it on, suggested they \"strighten\" it with the strightner and so on which was exhausting. They even pressured to see her without it but my wife was uncomfortable and refused.\n\n\nYesterday I got home and found that my wife was locking herself in the bedroom and crying. I asked what happened, She told me she woke up and didn't find her wig, then discovered my nieces took it and hid then urged her to come out so they could see her without it. My wife repeatedly asked them to give it back but they started laughing and recording , my wife got had to lock the door to keep a distance cause they didn't stop. I was fuming I went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but I was able to get the wig back. I lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. They said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. My sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. I told her her daughters were recording her! She saw nothing wrong in it and said I overreacted as well. I lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to stay at my home and they needed to leave. I later let them know about the eviction since they thought I wasn't serious and they started crying begging that I let it go. But my wife is no longer comfortable around them after what they did.\nMy sister called our eldery dad and he begged that I let them stay and insisted my nieces were just acting like typical teenagers. He offered to speak to my wife but I declined.\n\nThey've been begging that I chang my mind but I ket refusing. aita?",

      "body": "My friend Teresa cannot drive. For years since my other friend Mary and I have been able to drive she has been asking us to drive her places. To be fair, her parents are annoying. They have been dangling car keys in her face since she was 14 and have been saying they would get her a car and teach her how to drive; they have not. We are all 23-24 years old now and my friend Mary and I already know how to drive. \n\n\n\nFor a while I was the only one driving her around since her and Mary were not all that close. At first I didn't mind but she constantly wanted to go out to get fast food or take her to whatever store she wanted or needed. I hardly asked for anything in return, but when I did ask if she could buy me a drink or maybe offer me gas money here and there she brushed it off as a joke. If anything since she only ever carried cash I would sometimes end up paying for her things. Which most times she would forget to pay me back for. This continued for a while. I ended up getting frustrated and asked her if she could please ask someone else to drive her around because I really could not anymore. \n\n\n\nThis is where I messed up and got poor Mary into this mess. I told her maybe she could ask Mary since she does not work. Maybe they could also become closer friends. She listened and did just that. Since I've been better at putting my foot down I haven’t driven her around as often. Mary struggles less with putting her foot down with her. This in turn kind of annoyed Teresa and now when Mary asks for something in return she says stuff like “is I love you enough?” or if Mary or I say no to taking her somewhere she will say she will hurt herself as a joke until we say yes. Or she will convince us that we want to go to until we say yes. Mary and I have talked about this to each other and it makes us uncomfortable and we tend to fold when she says stuff like this and just take her where she needs. Most times she says thank you, too.\n\n\n\nRecently it has made me really frustrated though. Something small happened that really irritated me. I was dropping her off at home and she asked me if she could leave her trash there. I told her no, please take it. To which she went “ehhhhh’’ in response and then closed the door of my truck and still left her trash inside. Also I am an unreliable narrator for sure. I forget things easily, and she often throws this in my face when I confront her with something and that makes me scared of confronting her.\n\nI might be the AH because she is going through a lot in her personal life which I do not feel is my place to share. Adding onto that will hurt her feelings. \n\n\n\nWIBTA if I told her I wouldn't take her out anymore unless she gave me money back for gas or got me a drink? ",

      "body": "I won't respond to repeat questions, check the comments\n---------------\nMy family has two heirlooms that we give to a bride or groom when they marry. For the men, it’s a set of cufflinks, and for the women, it’s a bracelet. My oldest son and my oldest sister are married, and their spouses wore the bracelet or cufflinks at their weddings. This tradition is essentially our family’s way of saying, “We’re accepting you into the family.”\n\nWhen my future DIL got engaged, I gave her the bracelet and explained that it’s a family heirloom, expressing how meaningful it would be if she wore it at the wedding. I mentioned that she could wear it during the reception if she preferred not to wear it in the ceremony. It’s a white jade bracelet, and I shared its significance with her.\n\nNow, with the wedding only a few months away, there’s a problem. My daughter has been getting to know my future daughter-in-law, and she recently came to me, saying that my future daughter-in-law thinks the bracelet is ugly and has been complaining about it. She even showed me texts where my future daughter-in-law said some hurtful things about me, calling me a “controlling ass” for giving her the bracelet. This was hurt and it feels like a complete rejection, especially since she knows why it’s important. When I asked my son, he said he didn’t know anything about her feelings on this.\n\nSince she clearly doesn’t want or respect the bracelet, I asked for it back. That’s when things got messy. She made a big deal about how I was excluding her from the family by taking it back.\n\nNow, she’s pissed and calling me a jerk. My son also thinks I’m a jerk for taking it back, even after I showed him what she said. People are divided over this, saying that by taking it back, it implies I don’t see her as family or trust her with the heirloom",

      "body": "My (M51) wife (F48) and I have two children: Jake (M23) and Jess (F18). \n\nAlthough they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements.\n\nThis has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally. \n\nJake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her. \n\nHowever, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration.\n\nMy wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment. \n\nMy wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch. \n\nI still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well.\n\nAITA?",

She is my only sister's only child.\n\n2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws.\n\nMy MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her).\n\nI didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.\n\nLast week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.\n\nWhile I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said \"I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts\". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).\n\nThe next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money). \n\nWe did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was.\n\nPeople in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.",

      "body": "Today at our weekly team meeting one of my colleagues announced that she is pregnant and will be going on maternity leave in April. Everyone reacted with congratulations and excitement for her, and I did too. We all told her we're very happy for her and her family and wish her all the best. \n\nA few minutes later, I was in the elevator with her and 3 of our other team members (so 5 of us out of a total team of 11 people) on our way back to our desks. Just for the sake of conversation, I asked her if she is having a boy or a girl. Her face kind off fell and she grimly and shortly said \"boy\". I thought it was strange that she reacted like this, but let it go. \n\nThen after I was back at my desk, she came up to me and said that my question was inappropriate, that she was planning on announce the gender herself but I \"forced\" her to say it like that in an elevator, so now half of our team knows and it \"killed the magic\". I was honestly really confused and apologised profusely. She lectured me on how I shouldn't be asking personal questions and walked away. \n\nI honestly couldn't have thought this was in any way a personal question. Is it too personal? I'm a 24 year old dude and I don't know anything about pregnant women or babies or social customs, I guess. I was just trying to be friendly. AITA? ",

The visitors included her sister and husband, but was mostly friends. \n\nUsually my ex phones our son when she's downstairs (we live in an apartment building) and he goes down to meet her. Yesterday she called our son as usual, but asked him to ask me if she could come up because one of her younger kids needed to use the bathroom. \n\nI obviously said yes. She came up with her 3 younger kids. She didn't know we had company, so apologized for interrupting, before taking the kids to the bathroom. On her way out a couple of the guests stopped her for a quick chat (friends I've had since she and I were married) but it was only a few minutes. My son gave his little siblings some of the snacks that were out for guests.\n\nAfter they left my wife's sister was quick to call my ex rude for barging in. One of my friends replied to her saying something about small kids bladders and nothing more was said about it.\n\nHowever, after everyone but my wife's sister had left, my wife and her sister started talking about it and both agreed that it was rude and tacky. They couldn't believed she started talking to some of our friends. When I objected they said it was wrong of me to have let her in without asking my wife first, I said that's ridiculous. \n\nLater, my wife and I discussed it again and she said she found it embarrassing for me to just let her in like that. I asked why, but she said I wouldn't understand. \n\nAm I really the asshole here? I was trying to do a normal nice thing but now I feel bad about upsetting my wife. ",

      "body": "I (28F) planned a family trip with my parents and my brother (25M). Before I officially booked the Air B&B that we would all be splitting the price on, I sent each of them the listing, showing how many bedrooms, what accommodations, etc. I made sure to double check with my brother as the house is only 2 bedrooms. One room has 2 full size beds, the other a king bed. I asked if he would mind sharing a room with me as 3 bedrooms in this area were harder to find. He said it was fine because we’d each have our own bed and asked me to book it. Once our parents signed off on it, I booked it.\n\nWhen we arrive, before we even have our first night’s sleep, my brother declares he thinks he and I should alternate sleeping on the pull out couch in the living room. I say I’m not going to do that. If he doesn’t want to sleep in the room designated for us, that’s fine. But I’m not sleeping on a pull out on vacation when there’s 2 beds. I asked why he doesn’t want to share a room and why this didn’t come up sooner. He said we were adults and he was “too old” to share a room. I asked why he didn’t bring this up sooner. He said he figured I’d agree to the pull out situation. I said he shouldn’t have assumed or at least had a conversation with me. He kept insisting and I said no. If he wants to sleep out there our whole vacation, fine. But I’m not alternating when I paid for a bed.\n\nHim sleeping on the pull out lead to several conflicts with our parents as he’d get mad if they came into the living room in the morning while he was still sleeping but as they pointed out, it’s the living room, a public space. If people wanted to hang out in the living room at night, he’d start bugging us to go into our rooms so he could sleep, as early as 8 PM. We’re on vacation, we’re going to stay up a little later and hang out. I always offered to let him sleep in the extra bed in the room but he refused unless I promised that I would sleep on the pull out that night. Which I didn’t do.\n\nBy the end of the (7 day, 6 night) trip, he was irritated with all of us over this. My parents and I feel that he’s the one who put himself in the situation and that there was an alternative to him sleeping on the couch but he chose not to. However, my brother is insisting that I should’ve swapped with him. \n\nAITA for not sleeping on the pull out? ",

      "title": "AITA For telling my wife her parents are not allowed to ever watch our son again",
      "body": "My wife and I have a 2-year old son and have been married for 4 years.  Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.\n\nI was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  \n\nSo we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.\n\nWhen we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.\n\nI told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.\n\nI told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on.",

      "body": "My husband's 29th birthday was last week.  Three weeks prior, I told him I planned a lobster buffet for him with our 2-year-old. He was super stoked because he mentioned several times in the past that he'd never had lobster. I told him to tell me if he had something else in mine, but he loved my idea, so I booked the dinner, a $120/€100 reservation, plus similar-priced gifts, totaling about $240/€200 (a significant amount where I'm from).\n \nA week before, his mother texted, requesting an invitation. My husband said absolutely not and said he's tired of constantly footing the bill for his family's celebrations.  He usually provides food and gifts for others' birthdays and resents that he's not getting the same treatment for his birthday. \n \nSince the buffet was dinner, I considered inviting his mother to lunch.  He's annoyed by his family's expectations but I know he loves his mom very much and that he'd still love to spend his birthday with her. \n \nCrux is his mother also celebrated her birthday earlier in the month. My husband gave her travel money, and I gave her $100/€85 spending money. While away, she requested some additional cash which I happily gave.  Since then, I'd been transparent about my husband's birthday expenses, telling her my limited remaining budget so I mentioned that if she wanted to come, she should come alone due to financial constraints. She agreed.\nThe night before, she suddenly said she'd be bringing her mother and my husband's younger brother. I reiterated our budget limitations, but she insisted they wouldn't eat much.  I said I literally did not have any money to host more people and my husband was unwilling to pay for them. Bringing 2 additional persons meant compromising our grocery budget for the rest of the week. I eventually conceded but felt very disrespected. I didn't tell my husband but I felt so bad that I confided in my SIL, who then told my older BIL.  He ended up lecturing my MIL, then she texted, \"Yeah, let's probably just meet next time,\" and has since ignored me.  I now feel terrible.\n\nEDIT: My husband loves his mom and loves spending time with her. He just resents spending for her. I know I was stupid and disrespectful for violating his boundaries but he does not have a bad relationship with her as a lot of people are implying! I am still the AH but my husband doesn't hate his mom! ",

      "body": "I (30F) met this guy (28M) in January and he became my BF in February. Comes March, the world goes down the drain and we decided to move in together for the time of the pandemic. Everything is great.\n\n\nIn the morning, we have this routine where he browses Reddit and gives me the highlights. A few weeks ago, he shows me a post where this guy is challenged to an arm wrestling competition by his GF. The guy didn't seem to have any sort of training/work out whereas his GF did.\n\n\nI commented he might have a surprise. My BF started educating me on biology and how men are stronger than women. I told him there were way too many factors to take into consideration to make such a broad comment. I have been doing weightlifting for 2 years and my BF has never seen a gym in his life, so I used us as an example. That was a BIG mistake.\n\n\nHe got really defensive and condescending, and made comments like \"That's cute.\" I just let it go.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday. He's playing some game with his friend (online) and I can clearly hear him talk about me. Well curiosity killed the cat. \n\n\nAt first it's all pretty and my ego is bursting, but then he says I'm delusional because I think I'm stronger than him. Pause. \"Seriously? I know I'm weak but not weaker than a girl.\" So later, I decide to call him on his BS. I asked him if he wanted to come workout with me the next day (this morning) so he can show me how strong he is. He accepted and I was happy because I had been dying to bring him and initiate him to something I'm passionate about. \n\n\nSo, this morning, we went to my friend's (27M) garage (my region allows groups of 10 or less and we wipe everything). I told him we're gonna do deadlifts. It's my favorite exercise and I was already planning to test my personal best so it was perfect.\n\n\nMy friend was there cause he corrects my form and it's been our Sunday ritual since Covid-19. We started light and slowly worked our way up, doing the same number of reps as the other. Comes 185, his form starts to crumble so we made him go lighter. But 185 really isn't that much for me so I kept stacking the plates. He looked very supportive and impressed the whole time. I ended up beating my personal best at 265. I was ecstatic and so were they.\n\n\nWhen we got in the car, he was very silent. I assumed he was just tired. We got home and that's when he exploded and asked me if I was proud of myself. Apparently, I humiliated him in front of my friend. I apologized. I didnt realize he was feeling that way. He got angry and said it really changed the way he saw me, like I'm less of a woman now. He stormed to the basement. \n\n\nI started collecting my things, but now I'm wondering if I should have been reading between the lines and stopped at 190 or something. Or just dropped it and never suggested we workout together? I knew very well I was stronger than him but I just had to prove it to him. AITA?\n\n\nUpdate: I still didnt get a word of him but since some of you asked, I will make sure to update you when he does. Thank you for the overwhelming response. That was a bit of a rollercoaster day but it made it easier to know I'm not completely in the wrong.",

      "body": "I (29F) co-own a home with my mom and sister. I live in the basement, which has been my private space. Today, my mom told me that my cousin from overseas (who I barely know) and her two young kids are coming to stay with us for the entire summer, and that they'll be staying in the basement with me in the spare room. I'I protested and she called me selfish. I don’t even know the names of my cousins kids at all, and I value my personal space and quiet. I also work night shifts so when I come home in the morning to sleep I don’t want to be disturbed with any noise. \n\nAlso, my mom and sister are going on a 10-day cruise next month, and I was really looking forward to having the house to myself for once. My family can be pretty overbearing. When I brought this up, my mom just said, *“Well, now you won’t be home alone!”* like that was a good thing. I told her she made this decision without considering me at all and that I don’t plan to host or entertain anyone while they’re gone.\n\nFor added context: the last time a cousin stayed with us from overseas, my mom pressured me into giving her money so she could shop. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself, but 3x as much since she's bringing her kids too.\n\nAt this point, I’m so upset I’m seriously considering going to a hotel for those 10 days just to have peace. It feels like my space and comfort were completely disregarded and I don't want to give up my personal space.  AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT 1: My basement space is fully open to the upstairs there’s no door, just a staircase. So it’s not like I can lock anything or really block off my space, plus the laundry room is in the basement which everyone needs access to. \n\nEDIT 2: Yes, I legally co-own the home. My name is on the title and the deed. I live in the basement, which has its own living area and bathroom. There are two rooms down there, mine and a spare room that my brother uses when he visits like once a month, but he only stays for a weekend when he comes.\n\nThat spare room is the one my mom is giving to my cousins. They won’t be in my actual bedroom, but since the basement is open with no door separating it from the rest of the house, I’ll basically be sharing my entire living area with people I don’t know all summer.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: My cousin and her kids are here. My mom didn’t mention or speak of them coming again until last night, when she told me they’d arrive today. My sister went on her trip today, and when I told my mom they could sleep in her room, she said no because my sister is going away for a wedding only for a few days. I’ve just decided to book a hotel while my mom and sister are away for the cruise. I told my mom, and she kept nagging me, asking where I’m going, but I refused to tell her. All I said to her is that I hope she buys enough food for the three of them to eat, and that I won’t be entertaining them. She claims she doesn’t know when they’re leaving, which is ridiculous, and I have yet to speak to my cousin or her kids. I don’t even know the names of her children. I’ll be avoiding them for the duration of their stay. By the end of this year, I’ll be making plans to have them buy me out and start looking elsewhere to live. My mom tried to guilt trip me, saying I act like I don’t like my family, but I really need my space right now and I'm glad I didn't let her guilt trip me into thinking I was the wrong one in this situation.

      "body": "TLDR: SIL didn't want to go to my husband's birthday party and is now expecting us to plan another since she can't afford to host another one herself. WIBTA for saying no?\n\nHis birthday was last month. His family is obsessed with celebrating birthdays, even though we are all 30yo+. That's fine, but you can understand how hard it is to get 10+ family and friends together for every single birthday when everyone is working different schedules.\n\nWhen his birthday was approaching, I had heard nothing about plans but knew his sister had bought him tons of gifts, so I stepped up and sent out an invite for something my husband wanted to do - a barbecue at the beach. Free, relaxing, and a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nHis sister responded, disappointed, that she and her family would actually prefer dinner at a restaurant because they want to be indoors/in the AC. My first thoughts were that, if you are invited to an event that you can't or don't want to attend for some reason, asking the host to cancel or change those plans entirely is quite rude. \n\nIn an effort to stand our ground, we let them know we were going ahead with the barbecue, but if they wanted to plan a separate birthday dinner, they were welcome to. \n\nSo, SIL chooses this upcoming weekend for a family-feast-style dinner at a nearby restaurant. Neat! We adjust our schedules to accomodate. As the day approaches, husband reaches out to sister to ask what the plans are. Turns out, she has nothing planned - hasn't invited anyone else, hasn't made reservations, and hasn't looked at the menu to calculate the cost breakdown. \n\nThe family meals at the restaurant come to $120 each, feeding 4 people. That would feed SIL's family alone. With the rest of us added, we would need at least 2 meals to feed everyone. When we talked all this over with SIL, she realized that the cost splitting would still be over $30pp. That's when she admitted that they just paid their bills and can't afford it.\n\nNo worries. Sorry it didn't work out!\n\nNope. She's now asking *us* to plan something else, something that's less expensive, because she's out of ideas. \"Can we have the party at your place?\" Why, so I get to buy all the food and stress about prepping the apartment to host on short notice? \"Wish we could, but our house is a mess while we're reorganizing\". She is currently waiting for us to think of something else.\n\nConsidering: 1) we already hosted a birthday party that she didn't want to go to, 2) her poor planning would have ended with us footing a $200+ bill, and 3) the series of inconsiderate requests, my husband and I are ready to cancel. Knowing this would break her heart, WIBTA?",

      "body": "My dad owns a pizza place that was handed down to him from my grandfather.\n\nI've been working at the pizza place my while life, even part time while I got a business degree.\n\nI found out last early last year that my dad had willed the restaurant to my stepmom. His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.\n\nI was pissed and \"quit\" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.\n\nNow this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. \n\nMy dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.\n\nI declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.\n\nThe family restaurant however, is going under.  \n\nNow there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I left a note on my upstairs neighbor’s door?",
      "body": "Edit 3: there have been some helpful suggestions of swapping numbers, suggesting a pad under the treadmill to dampen the noise, and reviewing the lease terms. To those folks who understand the frustration and offered constructive feedback and advice, I appreciate that. Even if they thought I would be TAH, it is nice to have someone actually listen to my frustration and offer useful suggestions. I won't be writing a note, but I will be attempting to talk to him about this issue.\n\nI'm not going to argue with the people who accused me of trying to get him evicted, calling police (didn't do that), expecting him to never make any noise at all (also not what I said) and tried to assume the absolute worst possible thing they could about me. It's honestly wild how this went from a few comments saying they understood why I'm upset but I need to compromise, to accusations of me trying to get him thrown on the streets and expecting everything to revolve around me and being compared to old neighbors who have screaming matches and fight in front of the building (seriously what??) If that's what y'all got from \"my neighbor makes loud noises and shakes my ceiling and it's irritating me\" then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nI won't be responding to this thread anymore as I have gotten actual helpful suggestions and will be trying them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my fiancé live in an apartment building with a LOUD upstairs neighbor. He drags stuff across the floor at weird hours (midnight and later) runs his blender at 6:30 am, and the thing that annoys me the most is he runs on a treadmill at random hours for 30 minutes. This causes our ceiling to shake (I can see window frames and the ceiling fan vibrating with each step.) It also creates a loud thumping noise coming through our ceiling.\n\nI am really irritated by this. Honestly who wouldn't be? I don't particularly enjoy having to listen to stomping on my ceiling. It's especially annoying because I work nights and it wakes me up in between shifts.\n\nI have complained to building management. The property manager came by, heard the noise, recorded it on her phone, and went up to tell him to stop herself.\n\nIt did stop for a short time, but he seems to have moved the treadmill and started doing it again. So now instead of stomping on the ceiling in our front room, the stomping is in our bedroom. \n\nHe was told my management a second time to stop. He asked \"Is there a good time when I can?\" Honestly? No. Even when I'm not sleeping after a shift I don't want to have to hear thumping on my ceiling for 30+ minutes. I'm at the point I am ready to put a note saying \"Stop stomping on our ceiling\" on his door. \n\nMy fiancé says we should talk to him. But I'm pissed, so if I do, I don't think I'll have anything nice to say. My fiancé won't do it himself. \n\nWIBTA if I left a note? I feel like I've already gone through the proper steps with management.\n\nEDIT: I should probably add that it is stipulated in the lease agreement that tenants are not supposed to make excessive noise that disturbs other residents. I think dragging stuff across the floor after midnight and stomping on the ceiling counts. \n\nEDIT 2: General consensus is we should talk to him to work out a compromise. See if he has padding under his treadmill, show him what the noise sounds like because he may be underestimating it, etc. I just need a way to start this conversation because right now I feel irritated. My fiancé is the more diplomatic person between us but he's also very shy and doesn't like confrontation.\n\n-to the people who said \"buy a house.\" I'm not going to pretend that's a good suggestion. If I had the ability to just buy a house to deal with a noisy upstairs neighbors, I would already be living in one and this post wouldn't exist. No, not everyone has the ability to afford just buying a house. Idc if you think I'm TAH that's not a helpful suggestion. \n\n-There also seems to be a misunderstanding that he asked me when he could do this. He did not, and he's made no attempt to talk to me. He asked management if there was a time and they asked me. No other communication has come from them or him.",

      "title": "AITA for excluding my daughter’s “best friend” from her birthday party?",
      "body": "My (36F) daughter’s (13F) birthday was last weekend. There’s this trampoline park in town that offers sleepover parties where the kids could play for a few hours, watch a movie, and have a sleepover on the trampolines. Her school is very small, so there are only 20 students in her entire year. When we were booking the event, she said to only book 19 places. I asked her if she was sure she wasn’t missing out someone, but she assured me there were only 19 kids in her class, and I was just misremembering.\n\nFast forward to her birthday, and this girl “Kamilla” shows up with an entire box full of gifts: teddy bears, perfume, candles, nail polish, flowers, chocolates, etc. I remembered picking up my from school at the beginning of the school year and seeing her chatting and being very friendly with Kamilla, so I assumed they were quite good friends. When Kamilla went up to hug my daughter and wish her a happy birthday, she lightly pushed her away and told Kamilla she couldn’t attend as we forgot to book her place. I apologised to Kamilla and her mother and offered to talk to the people in charge and pay for her place, but my daughter insisted that Kamilla couldn’t come. Kamilla was very distraught over this and started sobbing.\n\nI pulled my daughter aside and asked her why Kamilla couldn’t join, even though they used to be friendly and she’d invited every other student in her year. She said that Kamilla was just really weird, obsessive, and creepy, and she didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. I asked her if Kamilla was bullying her, and she said no, she just didn’t want to be around Kamilla. Kamilla’s mother had found out about the party through another parent and Kamilla decided to surprise my daughter knowing she hadn’t been given an invite.\n\nI returned the gifts to Kamilla, apologised again, and gently told her that there weren’t enough spaces. Her mother started screaming at me, telling me that I was a grown adult woman bullying a preteen girl. I told her that it was my daughter’s birthday party, she could invite whoever she wanted. She accused me of raising my daughter to be a bully, and that she couldn’t just invite the entire class and exclude one girl. She claimed that Kamilla was my daughter’s “best friend” and she had to right to be invited.\n\nI told her that my daughter’s a teenager, not a 5 year old, she can’t be forced to invite the entire class just to be nice. I said that I didn’t want to raise a doormat. I didn’t want to teach her to value the feelings of others at the expense of her own - if my daughter feels uncomfortable around someone, then I prioritise HER wellbeing over that of a stranger’s.\n\nKamilla’s mother is now talking to the teachers to punish my daughter for “bullying”. I’ve tried explaining to her that my daughter was simply setting her boundaries, she shouldn’t have to face consequences for that. Kamilla’s mother said that I was an “evil b\\*tch” who “took joy in bullying little girls”. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting my hair after a friend's death despite a contract that dictates what I'm allowed to do - or not to do - with my hair?",
      "body": "I've \"lost\" my job and have been ostracized by my family, so I figured I'd come to the court of public opinion.\n\nOne of my best friends of over ten years lost her battle with the big C word on Christmas. Fuck cancer, y'all. I'm not handling it well, tbh. I feel like a really crazy person. I literally haven't stopped crying. \n\nThrough all the tumultuous emotions, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. \n\nI don't know why, but I felt like I wanted to get rid of a psychological weight and my hair was suffocating me.\n\n I 'model' and I've been doing it pretty much my whole life. My family is upper middle class due to my income. My parents 'work' as my mangers, even though I had actual, hired, experienced managers throughout the years. My dad works part time elsewhere, but I am the main breadwinner in the family. \n\nPart of my current contract was that I can't cut my hair without prior consent from managing parties or else my contract could be rendered void. It wasn't really an issue until now.\n\nFor a week, I tried to get consent, but nobody wanted to give it. So, over the weekend, I locked myself in my bathroom and chopped off almost all of my hair. I didn't go as extreme as 2007 Brittany, but I was definitely channeling her energy. \n\nNow I look like Steve from Stranger Things. \n\nI don't feel a lot better, but it was kind of cathartic. I'm glad I did it. My life changed, and I physically reflect that now.\n\nNow I'm unemployed, though, cause I was released from my contract and as soon as I'm done with high school, my family wants me gone.\n\nI know that I jeopardized my family's financial security, and my parents are scrambling to figure out how to pay the bills because I may have been an immature asshole, but, I dunno, maybe it's grief, but I feel pretty apathetic about it. I wanted to grieve in my own way.\n\nAm I the asshole for that?\n\nUPDATE: 6.35PM\n\nSo I talked to a few folks today, and I was sent a copy of the email exchanges that ultimately ended my contract. \n\nMy contract was set to expire in June, but I wasn't booking until May to give myself time to finish up my last semester in high school. Instead of terminating my contract or 'firing me', i was released from my contract in a really nice way. \n\nI won't copy/paste, but the gist is;\n\nHere at Company we value the health and safety of all our employees and it seems that Brittany is going through a hard time. Let's release her from her responsibility so she can enjoy school, and should she decide to come back after high school or freshman year of college, she'll be welcomed back into the agency.\n\nThey even sent a .pdf of therapists or counselors that I might wanna talk to. \n\nI talked to my old manager and she set me up in contact with a lawyer and already has access to copies of my documents, which she sent me in .pdf, too. I also contacted Jasmine's mom, who said that I can move in to finish hs if I'm kicked out in March. \n\nI'm not gunna say much, but what my parents were doing was definitely illegal unless I have trusts, which I doubt bc my parents both have nice new cars and stuff.\n\nI also emailed my school guidance counselor. \n\nI have a new email contact, and I'll be sent my financial records ASAP. \n\nSo... yeah. Posting this morning, I honestly felt like an ungrateful, whiny teen who fucked over her family, but you guys made me realize that my life is *definitely* not normal or fair, and I thank you all for that, and for the immeasurably kind words you've all given me.\n\nI'll keep fighting!\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot and somehow blocked someone while scrolling  in my inbox.",

      "body": "My (29f) friend (31f) has told me that her husband (35m) has a crush on me and has recently told her that he fantasises over me. This already makes me feel very awkward but now she has asked if I can stop wearing makeup and wear baggy clothes around him.\n\nWe went out for dinner last night at a reasonably expensive restaurant with a few others (7 of us in total) and she text me when I got home saying she was angry at me for ‘looking hot’ after she asked me to not wear makeup. She’s my friend and I want to do the right thing but there’s nothing I could wear that is baggy that would have suited the restaurant we were in (Michelin star). My style is very conservative and I was wearing a very average dress with heels.\n\nI’ve written out several responses ranging from an apology to being quite rude but wanted to sense check my thoughts here before I go back to her. I don’t want to make life difficult for her but what she’s asking for feels unreasonable. AITA? \n\nEdit 1: thank you so much for all of your responses. It’s 4.21am here in the UK so I will write out and send a response tomorrow and will update you all on here. Sorry I can’t respond to everyone; I didn’t expect so many responses. \n\nEdit 2: While I was reading your responses, he just liked an old Instagram pic from way back (bikini pic!). He is now blocked. \n\nFINAL UPDATE - Edit 3: I responded with the following: “Sorry it’s taken me a while to reply but I wanted to consider this properly and not react emotively. I’m sorry you feel that way but I don’t think it’s fair or reasonable to ask me to change how I look because of your husband. My advice is to speak to (husband’s name) and work on your relationship because projecting your issues onto me isn’t going to help you, but it will damage our friendship. You have nothing to be insecure about; you’re the most beautiful person inside and out I’ve ever met. I’m here for you if you want to talk through it but ultimately I can’t help it if I’m smoking hot (just kidding). Xxx”. \n\n5 mins after I pressed send she knocked on my door (she was already on her way) with a bunch of flowers and cried and gave me hug while apologising. She told me they were having problems and it was wrong of her to take it out on me. we’ve had a long chat and I’m going to be there to support my friend. Thank you all for your input; you all helped so much!!\n\nADDITIONAL INFO: I’ve had a lot of people message me asking if they can post my story elsewhere and a couple of reporters etc. I really don’t want to exploit my friend’s marriage so I don’t mind if you use it but please keep me anonymous. Also, WTF?! I can’t believe so many people care or have an opinion about my boring issue. X",

      "body": "My dad and stepmother got married when I (17f) was 7 and my brother (19m) was 9. My stepmother had two kids of her own who were 2 and 4 at the time. Our other parents are dead. Their dad and my mom. Their dad died while my stepmother was pregnant. My mom died 19 months before dad remarried. The only extended family my brother and I had was our mom's side and when dad remarried he insisted my stepsiblings had to be included or they couldn't see us. Grandparents rights were not available at the time so my grandparents agreed but they made it clear to dad they were only including our steps because they loved us and wanted to see us.\n\nSo whenever we saw our grandparents, my stepsiblings did, and they grew really attached despite my grandparents never feeling any different. My stepsiblings were a way to see my brother and me, not more grandkids or family in any way to my grandparents. It was the same for the rest of my extended family. They were treated fine but they were never loved or wanted.\n\nGrandpa died in 2020 and my grandma died a month ago. Grandpa's funeral was done over zoom but grandma's wasn't. My stepmother tried to send my stepsiblings up to the grandkid section at the funeral but an aunt and uncle stepped in and said it was only for grandkids. After the (non religious) service each grandkid got our \"grandkid inheritance\" which was a lovingly made memory book that our grandparents did for us and had entries up until the day before grandma died.\n\nMy stepsiblings got nothing. \n\nThis devastated them and there has been an atmosphere ever since. My dad and stepmother are furious and went crazy on my aunts and uncles about letting it happen. Then my dad told me I needed to show some sibling love and loyalty and take a stand against my extended family but I refused. My dad told me that wasn't okay and that I could not be so selfish. My stepmother said I owed it to my stepsiblings. I told them none of this was my fault and I would not turn away from my family over it. They said I was by choosing my extended family. I told them they are my family. I will not push them away. They said it was cruel what they let happen. I said it was their (dad and stepmother's) fault in the first place. I told my stepmother she knew my grandparents only included her kids because they wanted to see me and my brother and that dad had made them do it. I said they should never have let the kids believe they were grandkids to my grandparents. They were the cruel ones knowing my family had never loved the kids. And I said I would not stand against my family over this.\n\nThey flipped over me blaming them and they said my brother and I lacked empathy and compassion like our extended family did.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "This concerns my sister “Lily” who is graduating soon. Our parents taught us the importance of personal hygiene and keeping yourself presentable. But I guess Lily fell off the wagon while dorming in college because it feels like she dropped everything to do with personal hygiene since moving back home.\n\n\n\nIt’s easier to explain with a list of things she isn’t taking care of:\n\n\n\nHair: Very oily/greasy and always tangled from lack of wash and brushing.\n\n\n\nSkin: Also very oily/greasy from no wash.\n\n\n\nNails: Never trims so they’re long and yellow from grime.\n\n\n\nClothes: Clothes themselves are nice but she leaves them sloppy/wrinkled.\n\n\n\nBody: Showers once a week tops. I’m not sensitive to smell, but my sister REEKS and honestly makes me gag sometimes.\n\n\n\nLily is upset because she says she can’t get an in-person job in her field and wants to give up. Our parents have tried telling her that presentability/hygiene is as important as credentials when getting jobs, but my sister won’t listen. Lily has a rocky relationship with our family so she takes it as a personal attack rather than them trying to help.\n\n\n\nLily is now blaming sexism and says men are all just intimidated by a competent woman and that’s the sole reason why she hasn’t gotten a job. If she wants to lie to herself, it’s her life. Whatever. What I can’t stand is her trying to make it my problem and expect validation from me.\n\n\n\nLily just did a bunch interviews, but all went cold after and none panned out into jobs. She was venting to me last week about how companies in this field are all boys’ clubs and quick to shoot down a woman they know is intellectually above them. I was basically just like good for you, can I please finish my session in peace now?\n\n\n\nLily got defensive and said she’s just warning me. Then doubled down saying most men are selfish and I should save myself the headache now. She was saying this with my male friends on the voice call.\n\n\n\nI had enough and told Lily that her lack of personal hygiene is the real reason no job will hire her, so stop blaming others and think for two seconds: If you were a company owner who needs to impress investors to keep your own family afloat, would you want to be represented by someone who looks and smells like a homeless person, or someone who is presentable and takes care of themselves? \n\n\n\nWe got into an argument and Lily is now either giving me one-word answers or not saying anything to me at all. I’ll be honest that we argue a lot but Lily normally would have gotten over it by now. Did I do the right thing giving Lola a dose of reality or did I fuck up here?\n\n",

My sister (F36) has just split with her husband and started a new relationship with one of her colleagues (We will call him Brandon) who I have briefly met a couple times before but don't know very well, he's nice enough but my FH has never met him and like I say I don't really know him myself.\n\nMy sister mentioned to Brandon that she is my maid of honour and that I will be getting married in November within the first week of their new relationship. before my sister and her husband (lets call him Rhys) split they were both invited to the wedding, as they'd been married for 15yrs so Rhys was a big part of the family.\n\nBrandon automatically assumed he was invited to the wedding in Rhys' place, which I didn't like but sort of accepted that she'd want a plus one, and Rhys wouldn't want to come now anyway given the situation, so I let it go. she then informs me that Brandon has told his daughter Kelly (F10) who he co-parents with his ex that they're both coming to my wedding so Kelly is really excited.\n\nI reminded my sister that we are having a 'child free' wedding which was communicated to everyone who was invited to attend, as we ourselves don't have children, don't want children and so don't want children at our wedding which all our family and friends have been fine with.\n\nI've met Kelly, and she is unfortunately a complete brat, and definitely not a child we would want at our wedding regardless of if we're having a child free wedding or not. My sister thought our refusal was down to the cost of adding her as a guest when we've already reached maximum numbers, so initially offered to pay for her place.\n\nI told her it's not about the money but because firstly I don't like Kelly and secondly Brandon overstepped by assuming his child could come without even trying to talk to myself and my FH first. I also calmly told her that she knew we were having a child free wedding and should have told him straight away to avoid this happening. As it's also not fair to our other friends and family members who have arranged childcare for their own children to respect our wishes.\n\nShe's now calling me an AH because it's 'going to make things difficult' for her when she tells him that he can't bring Kelly as she's excited about going to a wedding. I told her that wasn't my problem as I am not responsible for him trying to muscle in on a family event he wasn't even invited to in the first place.\n\nI've offered to talk to him for her, to keep the peace, but she said I'd just end up being 'more of an AH to him' than I am already for telling her that her new boyfriends child can't come to my wedding.\n\nSo reddit... Am I the AH?",

I told her that she could go after my birthday as well but she did not listen and just went to a sleepover at her friend's place. \n\nI got really mad at her and instead of waiting for her to return home to talk things out, I asked my friend if he would like to hang out with me. He was fine with it so we spent the day fishing, grilling, hiking, and went to the Korean BBQ for dinner. \n\nWhen she came home after spending time with her friend, she apologized to me saying it was an unavoidable circumstance. I told her that it wasn't a problem and that I spent the day with my best friend. She got mad that I'd take him to the restaurant that we had booked for ourselves. I said that it was originally for us but since she prioritized her friend over me, I took the person who prioritized me on my birthday. She said that I'm controlling and that I shouldn't be deciding who she spends time with. \n\nNow she's neither talking to me nor coming out of the room. I think I went too far by telling her whom she should be spending time with.  \n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to punish or allow my wife to punish our son?",
      "body": "This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.\n\nMy wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.\n\nI gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.\n\nI (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to \"even the score.\"\n\nI told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?",

      "title": "WIBTA For not letting my roommate bring her boyfriend over if she doesn't clean?",
      "body": "Currently, I (21F) live with my sister (23F) and her friend (23F). Before that, my sister and I lived alone and everything was alright. However, about two years ago, her friend came to live with us. She got the bedroom with her own bathroom, while my sister and I share the main bathroom.\n\nA few months ago, my sister and I realized that she doesn’t do basic cleaning chores—she doesn’t take out the trash, mop the floors, wash dishes, or sweep. She only cleans her own room and occasionally takes out her own trash. This has become a serious issue because my sister and I are left handling all the household chores, even though we both work from home and already have full workloads.\n\nIt’s especially frustrating because she has a dog that she lets out into the living room, and it often pees and poos everywhere. If we don’t ask her to clean it up, she’ll leave it there for days. Meanwhile, I have a cat, and even though it’s rare for her to make a mess, I *always* clean up immediately without anyone needing to say anything.\n\nAnother issue is her boyfriend. She often tells us that he’s leaving early—around 9 p.m.—but he ends up staying until 11 p.m. almost every time, which makes us really uncomfortable. What bothers us more is that we feel obligated to clean the house whenever he comes over, even though she doesn’t contribute to the house cleaning at all.\n\nShe often uses the excuse that she’s rarely at home, unlike my sister and me who work remotely, but honestly, we don’t think that’s a valid reason. Especially because on weekends, my sister and I usually go visit our family, and when we return, not even the trash has been taken out. It just shows a complete lack of responsibility and respect for the shared space.\n\nBecause of all this, my sister and I have decided we need to have a serious conversation with her. I suggested we tell her that if she doesn’t start contributing to the cleaning of the common areas, she won’t be allowed to bring her boyfriend over anymore. It might sound harsh, but at this point, we need boundaries and shared accountability. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I set her that condition?",

      "body": "My bf and I have been getting into it a lot over his son. This used to be an issue long ago but we had gotten over that. Well recently he came to live with me and my family. Since then it's been constantly \"your confusing him\", \"you just need to stop trying to be right\", \"you never seem to listen or explain yourself were you can be understood\", ect...\n\nWell today, yet again it was one of those situations. We had said we would go to our storage unit to look for his son's pokemon cards. Apparently saying \"Yes we can go to the storage unit and look for your cards. I think it could be in the back though.\" Is not enough detail to not set up the expectation that there is a chance it can't be found right away or at all till more of the unit is emptied. Because of this I was scolded for not being clear, making a confusing plan and setting up an expectation that I knew where it was exactly so we would  be in and out. Am I wrong for just putting it the way I did? I ask because his son is nero-divergent and I am on the spectrum as well. I'm asking if I'm the Ahole in this situation because of this. We have so many arguments because of situations like this. \n",

      "body": "Some feel I (32M) should’ve handled the situation but I don’t see how I’m wrong. Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn’t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister’s fiancé -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son’s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). \n\nSurprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister’s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: \nMy ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn’t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he’s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fiancé into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith’s and Jesse’s best interest were my main priority. That’s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. \n\nI asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn’t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said “I thought this was family only what’s he doing here.” Loud enough where he could’ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. \n\nMy sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn’t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn’t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she’s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn’t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out. \n\nLike they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me, what’s the point of us working it out if that’s how she still feels toward my son? Well this is still causing some conflict since I “escalated” the feud by making her leave instead of actually talking to her . AITA?",

      "body": "I'm 31F and my husband is 36M. We have two boys, a 5yr old and a 7yr old. My husband works in an office and he has the option to work a few days a week from home, but he prefers not to because he says it's easier to focus in the office. I run a small business from home. I don't have a lot of daily work, just some emails and planning (maybe 3 hours a day?)  but the business does make about a third of our household income. But my younger son is home all day and just dealing with him takes a lot of energy. He's really high energy and will probably wreck something if you leave him alone for an hour. And then the older one comes home at 3 and both of them are with me until 8 or 9, which is when my husband usually comes home. A few days ago, I was really tired and I didn't make dinner. When my husband came home I asked him if we could just order something. He was also tired and we were both short tempered so we ended up snapping at each other. \n\nHe said I should have at least ordered before he got home and he was hungry, I said I forgot and it's not fair that food is always my problem. He said that I'm home all day and I even admit I don't have much work to do, so I'm basically a SAHM and should at least take care of dinner. I said he has no idea how much I do everyday, and he said he'd handle the kids for an entire day while also working from home just to prove it should be easy for me. I said sure, so he made the arrangements to work from home yesterday. \n\n  \nI slept in, and when I woke up he was already frazzled from getting the older one ready for school. He ended up having to cancel a meeting to make breakfast, and was worried about that. Then when he took another meeting later on, the boys went out to play in the yard and got super muddy and left footprints all over the house. which he then had to mop, and I didn't help at all. By this point I did feel sort of guilty because it was definitely harder for him to take care of work at the same time, but all I wanted was an apology. He said he was doing this to show that I do nothing all day, and if he just admitted he was wrong I would have helped out straight away. \n\nLater on he had another meeting, and he told the boys not to bother him for an hour. But about 20 mins in, they got in an argument about something and our younger one went into my husband's room to complain. He was really loud and my husband's video was also on, then he told the kid to leave him alone but he was upset and crying and wasn't listening. After a few mins my husband went back to the meeting and apologized to the other people. when it was finished, he was really angry at me. he said I could see what was happening and I just watched him struggle without helping. I said all you had to say was please help, he said I shouldn't be so petty and prideful. This probably made him look a bit stupid in front of his manager, but it was only a few minutes and I don't think It was the huge deal he made it out to be. ",

However, every now and then the family will have a person or two visiting for a a handful of days or longer (grandparents, a cousin of the parents, friends, etc) and they stay at the house. \n\nWhen this is going to happen, my wife makes a comment to me like “well preparing myself to spend my break making small talk instead of recharging”. She’s an introvert and definitely needs her recharge time, and without a break it’s 9 hours of energy sapping work. \n\nI suggested that she needs to communicate her boundaries to these people early on and explain that she really prefers to take her break without making small talk so that she can be recharged enough for the second half of the day. Of course, this is easier said than done and will feel uncomfortable to say. But it’s either saying it and making it uncomfortable for the other person momentarily and up front, vs saying nothing and making it uncomfortable for her for the entirety of that person staying there because she’ll continually have to “entertain” while she’s on her break. \n\nShe pretty much got short with me after that and seemed annoyed that I suggested she communicate clearly and put up healthy and valid boundaries. \n\nAITA?",

      "body": "\nOne of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend. \n\nAsking me to come over and \"have some fun\" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)\n\nHe also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. \n\nWhen I saw them, I was out with friends and was like \"What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem\". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... \n\nAnd I included dealing with this fucker as a \"workday problem\" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. \n\nOn Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:\n\n \"Hi 'Coworker'\n\nI'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)\n\nPlease only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. \n\n- OP\"\n\nI didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. \n\nAnd he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? \n\nI screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying \"As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack.\" \n\nHe stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked \"Is this a work question?\" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? \n\nHe walked off... \n\nI feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.\n\nAITA for sending that email?\n\n---\n\nEdit... \n\nLooks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. \n\nI'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.\n\nEdit 2... \n\n I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. \n\nIt's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? \n\nI do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.\n\nEdit 3...\n\nHoly shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. \n\nShe just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. \n\nI asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.\n\nI haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.\n\nEdit 4...\n\nHe was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. \n\nI owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.",

      "body": "\nThis has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.\n\nI M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.\n\nDespite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.\n\nI started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.\n\nHe never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. \n\nLast week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this \"opportunity\" away to someone else.\n\nI didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.\n\nIt's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",

Or when he invited a random woman into the house after mom's funeral and very clearly had sex with her while we were in the house and let the random woman wander around like she owned the place until the next day. He admitted to my sister that he cheated while mom was dying. I heard him confess to her. But stuff like that are dad's mistakes. He just didn't give any consideration to us.\n\nMy sister was like fuck this I'm out 8 years ago and she said even back then she'd never come back, which she hasn't.\n\nI sometimes cook for myself. I eat at friends houses a lot too. So the other day I went out to grab some ingredients and made a pasta bake for myself and my dad's wife and her kids came home while I was eating. His wife questioned me later in the day and asked where I learned to cook and I admitted my sister taught me. She told me it would be great if I taught her kids, it would give us some bonding time. I was like no, I don't wanna. She insisted it would be \"perfect\" and \"a sweet idea\". Dad didn't say anything. His wife's daughter said she really wanted me to teach her and got excited because she saw it as a done deal.\n\nWhen I didn't give in my dad's wife told me I should pass on the big sibling knowledge of cooking and it's important that I take on an older sibling role with her kids instead of acting like we're strangers. I said we really are. I told her I already have a sister and I don't need another or a brother. I also told her it wasn't my job to be her kids big sibling. She told me it's selfish to hold out when I had a big sibling to teach me.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "\nI (28F) am the oldest of 5 and I still live at home. My whole life I have been a caretaker for my siblings and parents, often sacrificing my own happiness in favor of the well being of others. I struggle with a lot of trauma as a result but I never minded much because I never had much of a social life. \nThree years ago I met my boyfriend (25M) and he’s wonderful. He takes care of me exactly how I need which has helped me heal in so many ways so, naturally, I like spending time with him. We are not financially stable enough to move in together yet so our current schedule is that I’ll spend every weekend from Friday night to Sunday night at his place together.\nAt home, i share a room with my sister (24F) and she is pretty emotionally unstable most of the time but recently it’s been made worse by the fact that 5 months ago she went through a break up. Now she needs a lot of attention and I spend every week night with her, going to the gym, watching tv together and going for target runs. So much so that I don’t have time to spend with my other siblings and recently she’s started to express anger over me spending the weekends with my boyfriend instead of staying with her. \nI’ve tried to reason with her and compromise by coming home to hang out on the Saturday mornings when he works but it’s never enough. \nWhen I bring the issue to my mom, she sides with my sister and says she needs me so I should stay home and that I’m being selfish. My sweet boyfriend wouldn’t mind if I did but as bad as it sounds, his place is the only place I can rest without everyone needing a piece of me. The only place I can be taken care of instead of taking care of everyone else.\nI don’t want to seem like I don’t care because I do but the guilt trips are taking a toll on me and I don’t know what to do. \nAm I the asshole?

My brother asked me to help him finish his basement, make a couple of rooms down there, add a washroom, add a kitchenette, and wire up a family room. \n\nI priced it out and said I would charge him $32,000 including materials. This was a sizeable discount. The bathroom alone I would charge anyone else 15,000. His wasn't even roughed in. \n\nHe never paid me. He always had excuses. I paid for the material and I paid my guys for the work. We did it when I had downtime so I didn't lose out on other money but it still sucked to get shafted. \n\nSo I put a construction lien on the house. He didn't care and I wasn't going to make him homeless. \n\nThat was two years ago. Now he got a new job and has to move. And to get a new house he has to sell his current house. Which he can't do because their is a lien against the property. \n\nHe called me to get me to remove it. He promised he would pay me as soon as it sold. I told him \"fuck you pay me\". \n\nMy parents called me to tell me that they would pay what he owes. I said I would agree so long as he paid them back and if he didn't then any money he didn't pay back had to come out of any inheritance we were getting, god forbid. And that interest started accruing from the day of the \"loan\". They agreed that that was fair. \n\nMy brother called me to scream at me for involving my parents and out inheritance. I reminded him that he involved them not me. \n\nHe finally took money out from a line of credit and paid me. With interest. I'm a reasonable man. \n\nThe house sold over asking and the finished basement suite made a huge difference on what he got. \n\nHe is still pissed at me for doing it but I did everything legal and by the books.",

      "title": "AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?",
      "body": "Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.\n\nBackground: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.\n\nWe were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'\n\nHe replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.\n\nWe didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'\n\nI was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.\n\nHe told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??\n\nHe screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.\n\nI tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.\n\nI'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. \n\nHis mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.\n\nThanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!",

Before that I had planned to go to Colombia to celebrate my girlfriends grandmothers birthday in Colombia from Friday to Monday 2 months from now, I am scared to ask my new boss given the fact that I haven’t even started the job and it’s only 2 months away from hire date. I just talked to my girlfriend expressing that I would just want to put my head down for at least 5 months and just work so I can show that I am a hard worker and that I’m not the type to take time off as soon as I start work, but she got incredibly pissed at me and told me she’s not going to force me to do something I don’t want to do, when it’s not that, I just don’t wanna look bad in front of my employer. She also wants to go to a bad bunny concert in January which I would have to ask time off for as well for her birthday gift, and I think that that is more important given the fact she has begged me for this since the start of this year. In my head I have 2 things to choose, either this long weekend coming up in 2 months, or the week we would do for the bad bunny concert, and I am leaning towards the week for the concert. She is mad at me and hung up on me and hasn’t texted me since (she never does that) and I feel bad because I would love to do both I just don’t know if it’s the right thing… I just got this job yesterday. Any feedback guys please let me know. ",

      "body": "40(f) husband is 37(m) we have 4 children together, but 6 kids total. Ages 6, 3, 1, 6 months. I am the sole provider. He has been a SAHD since 1 month before baby was born. I was also home until baby was 4.5 months old. \n\nHad a high risk pregnancy and insulin dependent. I went to all appts alone while he stayed with the kids. Needed an emergency c section, and also a BF mom. The other kids were also breastfed so nothing really new\n\nI didn’t get much help personally from my husband as he was managing the kids up dressed fed etc. I was getting up on my own, showering on my own, feeding, caring for the newborn on my own without his help even though it was hard and painful. I drove the newborn to multiple appointments while he stayed back with the other kids. I would also go pick up our 6yo from school. I wasn’t supposed to be driving or lifting, but I did to balance out what he did for the other kids. I was up at night with the newborn, and at times I’d sleep in until around 930 then come downstairs to be around the other kids and him. If I asked for help he’d immediately hand the baby back to me, and say things like “the baby doesn’t like me” or “there’s nothing I can do with the baby”.\n\nAfter a month PP, the 1 yo would nap from 12-3, sometimes the 3yo would nap the same time, or if not would have quiet time and wasn’t any trouble. I’d still take kids to appointments, pick up 6yo from school, organized all clothes and separated them as we used hand me downs. Meal prepped 30 freezer meals, managed and paid all the bills, got the groceries. He’d leave for the gym the second the 1 yo would lay for nap. Come back, nap, wake up for me to get 6 yo from school. Once I returned. He’d leave with 6yo until 5-530pm. I’d try to have dinner ready in between nursing the newborn and the other littles. Then begin bedtime routines. If I tried to sneak away for a shower I’d still come back down to a screaming baby. \n\nOnce I went back to work, I kept asking what can I do to help. I’d still leave work early to pick up 6yo. He kept saying there’s nothing I can do. So I believed him. When i got home from work i would be bombarded by the kids. I’d prep dinner for them and helped with bedtime routine. I wouldnt be able to change out of my work clothes until around 9pm. After being back at work for all of 10 working days, he decided he needed to leave for a while out of state to his family. Leaving me to find daycare for the kids while I’m still working full time. While he was away his parents paid for his ticket, gave him money, got new shoes, went golfing with a friend.\n\nHe returns and tells me that he left because I was wrong for not helping him and he was burnt out because I was being lazy and I just wanted to sit and hold the baby all day everyday and that I do nothing to help him. He said I “took advantage of him”. I told him i dont believe I’m wrong and that I don’t believe it is a right or wrong situation, we were both doing what we can. AITA",

Rowan and Jack kept laughing then this young lady walked towards us cause her car was parked next to mine in the parking lot. Rowan kept trying to speak to her while she was trying to load her stuff in the car. he and jack kept throwing words at her and she sermed annoyed. Jack then said \"hey, he just wants to look at that a**\" then Rowan said \"Let me see it jiggle, baby\" I was appalled, I told them both to knock it off but then Rowan satcastically replied \"Relax I was just giving her a compliment, bet she don't get many of those often\". The lady got in her car and I started arguing with him about his behavior and shamed him for acting like this on his own engagement night. He argued back saying something about my car and I lost it. I told him to get out immediately, Jack got involved so I kicked him out too. My wife got back and started engaging in the argument sayingI can't let her son walk home from his emgagement party, I replied that her son can't be harrassing other women on the way back from his engagement party but she kept defending him.

      "body": "My dad and I (22F) run a small business together. My brother (27M) used to help out when he was in college so he understands how things work. Sometimes when we’re buying exclusive product sellers only let you buy one per address. In those cases my siblings help us out by ordering from their address, and we reimburse them. No one has ever made a big deal about it, it’s not a lot of effort, and they don’t pay anything out of pocket.About 8 months ago, my brother agreed to do this again for us. We sent him the money ( $2,000) he placed the order and that was that. But the product never showed up. My dad spent almost a month dealing with customer service and eventually had to pretend to be my brother to get the refun, because my brother refused to help. After more back and forth, my brother finally sent the refund to my dad. A few months later, out of nowhere, the product shows up at my brother’s house. He called to tell me not to tell our dad because he wanted to do it himself. The next day my brother comes over to my dad’s asking questions about the product like how much is it worth? How much money do you make on that? He hangs out for a little then leaves without mentioning that the product arrived. He then calls me the next day saying he plans to try to sell it to our dad I say I think he’s wrong for this because the product was never his. He argued that because it came to his house and the refund had already been issued, it was his now. I disagreed, told him I thought that was super shady & that it still belonged to my dad in principle. later that week he comes by dad’s house again & says Christmas came early ! then proceeds to offer to sell it to our dad. My dad offers $1,000 just to avoid conflict. My brother turns it down, saying “It’s worth more,” “I can sell it myself,” and then throws in, “I’m doing you a favor even offering it,” & “I’m nice, but I’m not $2,000 nice.” At that point, I stepped back. I work with my dad every day, and my brother is my best friend, so I didn’t want to escalate anything. There has been lots of tension between them since. 6 months later my brother is moving out of his apartment & I offer to come bring some boxes over, When I show up, he’s super behind. I end up staying all day packing, cleaning, loading stuff and the whole time he’s nitpicking everything, being short with me, complaining about how I do things, just his usual ungrateful attitude. as I’m unloading the last of the stuff I see the product untouched. After everything, after how he treated my dad and how he treats me all the time I decided I was done. I took it and put it in my car. Then next day he called me & demanded I bring it back I told him “you cant steal what was already stolen” he told me “I ruined his relationship with our dad” & “I’ll regret it.” I told him “no you did that.” now hes telling everyone im a theif & sending me rat memes.

      "body": "I’m 21F, and my older sister (25F) and I have always been close, but we tend to clash because she’s a perfectionist and gets hostile when things don’t go her way. One night, she called to say she was going into labor and asked me to watch her puppy. I agreed, and she gave me detailed instructions, including putting the dog in a safety harness when taking him outside.\n\nLater, I took the dog out and brought him back in, but I hadn’t fully taken off his harness when he ran toward the living room where my mom was on FaceTime with my sister’s boyfriend. I finished taking the harness off, but minutes later, I got angry texts from my sister accusing me of mistreating her dog because he was still in the harness for a few extra minutes. Her boyfriend had seen it on the FaceTime call and told her. She then called, yelling that I was lazy and unreliable, and told me and my mom to leave her house immediately. She even said we wouldn’t meet the baby until we earned her trust back.\n\nAt 2 AM, we left, and I asked her boyfriend what was going on when he arrived. He just brushed me off, saying, “We’re having a kid, you don’t get an explanation.” I spent the night comforting my mom, who was really upset, thinking she might not see her grandchild.\n\nThe next day, my sister called to apologize and blamed her reaction on stress and hormones. She invited us over to meet the baby, so we went. The visit was fine, but afterward, she asked why I seemed quiet. I calmly told her how hurt I was after being kicked out, insulted, and threatened. I explained that the situation left a lasting negative memory for everyone—her boyfriend missed moments at the hospital, my mom was devastated, and now her in-laws probably think we can’t handle helping her. I just wanted her to acknowledge my feelings.\n\nInstead, she got defensive again, saying she stood by everything she said and that I was disgusting for trying to put a dark cloud over her baby’s birth. She then asked me to leave, which I did. We haven’t spoken since, and while I understand she’s under a lot of stress, I’m left wondering if I’m wrong for wanting my feelings to be acknowledged.",

      "title": "AITA for calling my husband unreasonable for canceling the holiday trip just because me and the kids coupdn't help him in an emergency?",
      "body": "My husband and I have been together for 4 years. I have two kids (17m /19f). and their half brother is 3 years old.\n\n\n\nthis past week. My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.\n\n\nHe came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.\n\nHe yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying \"good riddance\"\n\n\n*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*\n\n\n*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",

      "body": "I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\n\r\nWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\n\r\nCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?",

      "title": "AITA for “ruining” my sister in law’s honeymoon by exposing her racism?",
      "body": "Throw away account although my sister in law will probably recognize the story anyway so I don’t know why I even bother. I don’t think what I did was an AH move at all but maybe the timing was a bit off but No, I don’t think I’m an AH full stop\n\n\nMy (f27) sister in law (f30) got married last weekend. She’s my long term boyfriend’s (m32) sister. They’re white and I’m Middle Eastern. And a dark one with raven black hair. She was looking for a photographer that didn’t bankrupt her so I suggested a friend of mine who’s new in business and charged less than half because these things cost over € 5k these days. She was excited and I set a group chat with her and my photographer friend. We talked a little and later they met and they started messaging directly to each other. \n\nThe wedding was amazing and everything went smoothly. I was one of the guests and she seemed happy. The next day they went off to their honeymoon. I don’t know if it was by mistake but instead of texting the photographer directly like she’s done for the past few months she texted him to our old iMessage chat. She thanked him but had a favor to ask him and wondered wether he could retouch some asymmetry in the (flowers archway? I’m sorry I don’t know the right terms in English) but also if he could take me off some photos because I’m too dark and ruined the color palette. Not all pictures. Just the ones she’s in. \n\nI texted back are you kidding me?\n\nShe didn’t answer. I took a screenshot and posted it on my insta story tagging her in it. She called my bf crying her eyes out calling me an ah for embarrassing her and ruining her honeymoon. Bf thought it was a low blow. I was blinded with rage when I did it but even now I’m calm I still don’t feel that I was an AH. But people have been contacting her apparently asking if she really wrote this. She’s so beautiful and successful so please don’t blame it on jealousy or scare of being outshined.\n\n#**edit for a little update**\n\n[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwwaaway22/comments/w220ia/update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n1) Sister in law is still on her honeymoon so I haven’t talked to her yet but she’s bombarding my bf demanding that I apologize and make a new insta story with my apology. More people got involved including my Bf’s mother that thought I was way out of line ruining her daughters wedding. I have also got contacted by my sister in law’s friends, some of them told me stories about what she’s been talking about me behind my back. Yeah she got what she deserved. The amount of her friends that weren’t surprised at all with her text made it clear for me that I wasn’t wrong.\n\nMy sister in law is self employed with some foreign customers thats why she’s taking it so hard because she’s scared that would affect her career. I don’t feel like I need to save her career should something bad happen to it.\n\n\n2) My photographer friend did what he was told. Thats the only right way imo. Being professional and not confuse work with his own values. He asked me if I wanted him to say something and I said no. I also asked him not to tell me what they’re texting since she’s his client so he shouldn’t break confidentiality. He’s just starting his career and he will meet worse brides. She was at least nice to him throughout their interaction.\n\n\n3) now to my bf. As I said he thought this whole thing was uncomfortable. I told him if he wanted to be with me he needed to discuss uncomfortable topics. He opened up and it was actually deeper than this. This has happened before. His uncle is very rich and for his 60th birthday he had a very big party. As a thank you we received thank you cards with our pictures on it professionally taken. I remember this picture because his uncle had a “red carpet” moment when guests were photographed upon their arrival. Later we went to my bf’s mother to see the rest of the photos and I wasn’t in any of them. I thought it was funny how I literally evaded being caught on camera. I never mentioned this or even reflected on it and while my bf and his family were looking at the pictures and discussing the evening it was just so normal and no one mentioned something out of the ordinary. Today he told me that I was photoshopped off the pictures. Everyone in his family knew it but me. At the time they just thought the uncle could choose whoever he wanted to have in his pictures and they moved on\n\n-but you all kept it from me \n\n-yes\n\n-so you must’ve thought it was hurtful \n\n-i did, I asked my family not to tell you\n\n-and we continued going to that uncle. Celebrated some Christmases, Easters and vacations with him?\n\n\nSilence\n\n-you didn’t feel offended on my behalf?\n\nSilence \n\n-and now you think it’s okay that your sister is doing the same?\n\n-I didn’t think of it that way I know my sister. She nit a racist.\n\n-if it wasn’t racist why is she feeling “embarrassed” now? \n\nSilence \n\n\n-you think what she did was alright?\n\n\n-of course not!\n\n\n-will you just stand and watch when this happens to our children \n\n\n-OF COURSE NOT.\n\n\nI know my bf very well. He’s very kind and I never felt he was racist in anyway. I know he’s not stupid and is aware of these things which makes it worse because it just means he doesn’t care enough. I asked him why he didn’t care enough and he said he was so sorry but he knows me to be a strong girl that never let these petty things affect her. He’s right, I normally ignore 99% of the racism and micro aggressions I face in life and even laugh at the ignorance. We even discussed this before. But does being strong mean that people are entitled to try to hurt me? Because I usually don’t let them? Does it mean I wouldn’t appreciate to feel the support of my bf having my back? Don’t strong women deserve being supported by their loved ones and feeling safe and loved? He couldn’t answer this.\n\nI told him that I never want his sister in my life again or his uncle and probably not his mother either if she still wants me to apologize. I don’t want to surround myself with people like them and especially when I have children and I asked him if he’s willing to live like that. I asked him not to answer me now and think about it. It kinda felt like an ultimatum and thats bad but I didn’t know how to handle the situation better. \n\nI never thought of myself as someone who’s petty or that makes ultimatums. This experience taught me that I’m both🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n\nAnd thank you for the NTA judgment <3",

      "body": "\n\nI (f29) have been dating my boyfriend (m35) 'Ricky' for 5 months. He's divorced but hates this word and goes with the word \"divorcee\" instead since the first one makes it sound like he was \"dumped\" when it was him who initiated it.\n\n\nAnyways, He always go on long rants about his exes and say stuff like \"I hope you don't have this awful habit my ex has\" or \"hope you like XYZ cause my ex didn't\" and the list goes on.\n\n\nI found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.\n\n\nLast night he invited his family to join us for dinner. We got to the restaurant first. He asked me if I \"brought\" enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said \"I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence!\" he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said \"well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway\" while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't.\n\n\nI went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute \"you're making money a priority just like my ex did\" then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came.\n\nWe've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",

      "body": "My mom never wanted a boy. She wanted girls. Apparently her dream was 4 daughters. But she had me (16m) first. I have seen photos and videos of the day I was born. She cried hysterically when they told her I was a boy. Then she refused to hold me. After we were cleaned up she cried about not using the name she had chosen and said she didn't know how to move on from it. All this was caught on camera. Eventually my paternal grandma took me and she was the person to hold me in photos and videos taken during the rest of our hospital stay.\n\nMy paternal grandma was my sole parent figure for the first 8 years of my life. She took care of me and I spent so much time at her house. Sometimes I was there for weeks. Then she had a brain bleed and died. So I was left with a mom who wanted girls and not a boy and a dad who wanted to be a provider and nothing more.\n\nMy mom had my sister \"Lily\" two years after me. So mom got her girl and Lily got all her attention. While I got grandma until I was 8 and then nobody. \n\nMy mom and Lily are super close and mom adores Lily. Lily got the bigger bedroom, she gets the gifts, she gets all her favorite snacks, she gets to do all the extra curricular activities she could ever want and her birthdays are huge parties with huge gifts. Christmas she gets at minimum? 25 gifts from mom alone. Mom typically gets me one... never anything I'd like or want but you know, thought that counts (which is zero).\n\nMy mom's family don't act too interested in making up for my lack of parental love. And in the last couple of years mom and I have argued more and I give her a hard time. Dad's never around to give him one. But mom? If she wants to ignore me than she can hear how shitty it is and if she wants to treat my sister like a perfect angel then she can hear about it. Mom has mentioned how I ruined her dream of four daughters.\n\nWe were at mom's parents house Friday and mom gushed about Lily doing good on a project and the scooter she got Lily to help her get around easier. She got Lily a custom helmet and a personalized lock for her scooter. She couldn't stop talking about it and I told her she really does love to shower her favorite in gifts and praise. My mom's family told me I should take it easier on her and said I should understand we had \"some little troubles\" because of mom's gender disappointment. I told them I don't owe her shit because she had gender disappointment and that I didn't ask to be born to a mom who only wanted daughters. They told me I lacked adult understanding and compassion.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "I (34F) have a (5M) son who attends preschool. A few hours after I picked him up from school today, I got a phone call from his teacher. She made absolutely no effort to sound kind when she, in an extremely rude and annoyed tone, told me to stop packing my son such “disgusting and inappropriate” lunches. I felt absolutely appalled when she said this, as me and the teacher have, up until now, always maintained a very friendly relationship. She added that the lunches I’m packing my son are “very distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.” I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son’s preferences. \n\nThe usual lunch that I send him to school with is small celery sticks with blue cheese and goat cheese, kimchi and spam (we are Korean and he absolutely adores this dish), and spicy Doritos marinated in Sriracha (I know, I know, but he deserves a snack, and I don’t put that many chips in the baggy.) \n\nI ended the call by saying that I very much appreciated her worries, but that at the end of the day, I am not going to drastically change my sons’ lunches all of a sudden, and that it’s not my fault if other students are “distracted” by his meal. It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches. \n\nThe teacher sent an Email to me an hour ago saying that my response was “unacceptable” and that his lunches are “just too inappropriate to be sent to school any longer.” I haven’t responded yet and don’t want to. I want to maintain a healthy relationship with my son’s teachers. I am confused as to what to do. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For Ruining A Child's Life?",
      "body": "Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was \"Grain\" so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something \"special\" to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.\nShe told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gráinne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) \nI tried to be very tactful, and I was like, \"Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky.\" \nThe kid is called Gráinne. Not Grain. \nMy partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.\nI said \"an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names.\" I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said \"well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like \"gro-nyuh\".\"\nHer face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. \nShe told me that I \"ruined her daughter's self-esteem\" and that her \"life [was] ruined\" by me saying that \"her existence is wrong.\" I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gráinne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. \nHindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: spelling and syntax\nEdit 2: Some people have assumed that we're in the USA, we're in the UK, in a city with lots of Irish people, an Irish centre, and a great Irish folk scene.

      "body": "\n\nSo I (34 f) have a little sister (28 f) that needed somewhere to go to get her and her 3 small kids away from her abusive boyfriend. My wife and I had just moved across the country, back to my hometown, to be closer to the family literally about two weeks prior to us giving her somewhere safe to stay. Shortly after that she made up a story about taking the kids camping with her two best friends. Later, we find out (from the kids) that they were actually with said ex boyfriend. I sat her down and explained to her that I knew the truth and that I knew she lied to me. She altered the story slightly to include him saying he “just showed up” yet none of the other friends were even there😐\n\nFast forward to this weekend and my wife and I are out of town. Sister is at the housing watching the dogs so she reaches out and says her and her best friend are taking a trip to Colorado. Cool. I tell her to have so much fun. We converse a bit about Colorado over the weekend and then I went to text her again and her location popped up (she had said a few days before that she was setting up Siri and it must have messed up her location settings when I asked why her location was off). Her location said she was in Arkansas (which she used to take a lot of trips to when she was dating the ex boyfriend) so I straight up ask her “hey why are you in Arkansas?” And she replies saying they changed the plan due to money and I said “Is that true? Cause I know you went to AR with *ex boyfriend” all the time and really hope you’re not lying to me again”. She went on to assure me she was telling the truth even adding in more detail about her friend and what they did.\n\nThat was yesterday. I got an unrelated call today from one of my best friends. We talked about things in our lives going on since I’d been out of state and then she asks if my sister was dating that guy again. I ask her why she’d ask and she says because they just went on a trip together and she saw it on facebook. He posted multiple pictures and even named the exact place my sister had claimed to be with her friend. \n\nI set a boundary, after the first lie, that if she wanted to live with us then she couldn’t also be with him. Now, if she wants to go date that loser then it’s her life and she absolutely can…just not while living with us. Also, that she can’t lie to me. We are trusting her with our home, our pets, and everything that comes with it. It’s supposed to be our safe space and this guy is OFF THE RAILS with alcohol, drugs, and violence. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to kick her out for lying to me and hanging out with him?",

      "body": "My dad passed three years ago and it's been tough on my entire family, including, obviously, my mom who had been married to him for 30 years. \n\nOne year later, she told me she met someone on the internet. Then, a few months later, that she would like to move to her home country (Central Africa) to be with him at least six months a year or so. The man is also from the same country as her, and has acquaintances in common with her, but I don't know him and I feel uncomfortable at the speed my mom found a replacement for my dad. \n\nThen, she started to act like he was part of the family now. Asking me to do things for his relatives who live here in Canada, and trying to force conversations between me and his own daughters on the phone when they call her. My sister and I were very clear that she can do what she wants but we don't want to hear about it until she sits us down to have a serious conversation about this man and what they're planning to do. It's been months now, and she still hasn't done it. Every time I remind her that I don't want to hear about it over the phone because it makes me uncomfortable and we didn't get to sit down as a family (my older sister and I) I don't want to meet his family, least of all this man. She proceeded to yell at me over the phone, telling me that I wasn't being supportive and that I wanted her to be alone. That she was an adult and could do what she wanted to do. Yet she still doesn't make any attempts for all three of us to have a conversation. \n\nI think she's afraid that we won't approve. She already lost long lasting friendships over this (people who were closed with her AND my dad). And now my dad's family is starting to pressre me for answer because she's on social medias like Facebook etc. talking about her new boyfriend etc. \n\nMy mom isn't a yeller, and the way that she snapped at me really strained our relationship a lot. It makes me want to spend less time with her, because I feel like I have to be the mom when I'm the youngest and I'm still grieving my dad. I don't know what to do and I feel bad that I can't support her. \n\nI really appreciate honest opinions because I know culturally she's not used to being on her own. She doesn't watch tv or read, so I know it's tough on her. AITA? ",

      "body": "my (23f) girlfriend (25f) got pulled over and searched by the state police and is blaming me.\n\ncontext: My girlfriend and I took a day trip two days ago. We had packed a joint and smoked it up upon arrival. I also ended up smoking the rest of the joint on the way home. There was also an empty glass pipe (from an earlier vacation, that I had forgotten to take out) in the little pocket on the passenger side door. My girlfriend drives for work, so her vehicle is essentially her office.\n\ntoday, my girlfriend left for work. She had not even gotten 10 minutes down the road before she was pulled over by the state police for illegal tint. She does have a very dark tint on all of her windows. apparently the officer smelled weed (from this weekend, I assume), so he decided to search the car. He ended up finding the empty bowl. thankfully, my girlfriend did not receive any citation or ticket, just received a warning about her tint. I was in class when this was happening. She texted and called me a handful of times. When I finally picked up, she began screaming at me about how I almost made her lose her job and how stupid it was, how reckless it was, how I said I was going to take the bowl out before, things like that. She just kept yelling about how bad things could have gone.\n\nmy question is, would I be the asshole if I told her it was just as much her fault as it was mine? \nWe both smoked the weed on our trip the other day. Plus, the whole reason she got pulled over in the first place was for her tint, which was something she chose and paid to do.\n\nTLDR: am I the asshole if I tell my girlfriend it’s her fault, after she got pulled over for illegal tint and they smelled weed in her car?\n\nETA: we live in a legal state. we both smoke and use the same weed & equipment. i’ve already apologized for my role in things numerous times but she keeps bringing it up and harping on it. she has had the tint for years and has been stopped before. she doesn’t want to fix it.\n\nwe smoked when we arrived then were there all day. it was 12+ hours later when we went to leave. i lit up 15 minutes from the apartment on the way back because we don’t smoke inside and it was raining.

      "title": "AITA for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him “uncomfortable”?",
      "body": "Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife’s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She’s 22, I’ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She’s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She’s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.\n\nBut then my wife goes, “And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he’s 47.”\n\nI’m 41, my wife is 42. I was like “You’re kidding, right?”\n\nShe wasn’t kidding. At first, I was like “Hell no.” But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I’m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.\n\n1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it’s weird).\n\n2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?\n\n3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?\n\n4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman’s history with her father? \n\n5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?\n\nI know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). \n\nSo, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. \n\nAfter only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. \n\nI told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.\n\nWell, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.\n\nSo Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?\n\nEDIT: some info:\n\nI asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.\n\nI would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. \n\nWhen I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.\n\nI would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you here asked what’s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They’re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. \n\nTalked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. \n\nAsked why they broke up.\n\nThe guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him.",

      "body": "My (24F) parents (60M, 48F) planned a mini (3 days) family trip as they do every year. They invited both my fiancé (28M) and my younger brother’s gf. \n\nI’ve been dating with my fiancé for over 2 years, but we got engaged just about 3 months ago. My brother (20M) has been dating his girlfriend since 9th grade, so she’s like family. For my fiancé, that was not the case. He didn’t join any of our previous family trips when we were just dating. This was going to be his first time joining us. I was so excited.\n\nLet me start by saying this; My fiancé's dog is not just a pet. She's a seeing-eye dog. He's fully visually impaired and he NEEDS her. She's not just our pet, but also basically his mobility aid. She's also the sweetest, most calm dog you will ever see.\n\nLong story short, when my mom \"found out\" we were planning to bring her with us, she got surprised and asked me if we really thought bringing **that dog** along was a good idea. I said “of course, what else did she think was going to happen?\"\n\nApparently, that was a ridiculous idea. They love her but certainly don't want her on the family trip. I told her I'm sorry, but that's not an option. If she wants us to be there, \"that dog\" will also be there. Every time we went on a trip with my fiancé, she was always there and never caused an issue.\n\nMy mom told me she respects that.  We can spend our couple trips however we want, but this is a family trip, and we must respect their wishes. I didn't know what to say to that. The only thing I could say is I'm sorry, but we can't attend if they don't let us bring my fiancé's seeing-eye dog.\n\nThen she got furious, she started calling me names , told me I’m being ungrateful, disrespectful etc. I didn't want to argue with her anymore, so I just hung up the phone. Then my dad called me to fix things up. He said it's just a 3-day trip, and I could very well “guide” my fiancé if I wanted to. I'm the one making things harder and even if he can't join, I should still come. \n\nThis made me lose it completely. I told him if my brother's girlfriend is going to be there, my fiancé should absolutely be there and I'm not making anything harder. They are the ones making this harder, and honestly, this is textbook discrimination. \n\nMy dad completely dismissed me, telling me to “shut up” and that if they were bigots, they wouldn't have let me get engaged to him. They always let him bring her to family dinners. This is the one time they asked for a favor. I should have been more understanding. He said i should be ashamed for making my mom cry when all she wanted was a small trip with both her kids.\n\nNow I feel as if I'm a horrible daughter. AITA?",

I won’t go into the details because it is gory and irrelevant. My mom rushed me to the nearest hospital, and while the doctors were cleaning my wounds, she took pictures to send to my dad. At that time, my aunt had gone out to meet an old friend. My grandma told her what happened, and in a panic, my aunt called my mom. To calm her down (because what she was imagining was apparently way worse), my mom sent her the pictures.\n\nThe next morning, while we were on the train ride back home, my other aunt called to check on me. I had a long conversation with her, and then my grandad asked me about what the doctors had said and stuff. Then out of nowhere, aunt *forwarded them to the family group chat*, captioned “my name’s vacation scars.” I saw it almost immediately, and I was PISSED. I asked her to delete them. She tried justifying it by saying everyone already knew, it was just the family gc and that it wasn’t a matter of privacy since it was just my leg. I went off at her in anger and asked her if she would have the same reaction if i sent pictures of her son's injuries the next time he hurt himself and how insensitive and unfunny her caption was. I also called her an attention seeker. Thankfully, my mom backed me up and the pictures were deleted. Only my cousin (my other aunt’s daughter) had seen them, and she was literally traumatized.\n\nBut then my aunt started acting like she was the victim, whining about how we’re all “growing up too much” and don’t value or love her anymore. Later, while my mom and aunt went out to buy food, my grandparents started talking to me. They took my aunt’s side completely, saying things like “we’re family, what privacy?” and “it’s just your leg, what consent?” Mind you they hadn’t even *seen* the pictures, so they had no idea how bad they were. I told my mom about this later and she said it was a generation gap thing, plus in our culture, respecting elders (aka being submissive AF and never questioning them) is treated like the ultimate virtue.\n\nA few days later, my aunt invited me to her place because she was making my favorite food. But even then, her behavior was… off. My mom also mentioned that she hasn't been calling or texting her much since it happened (they’re usually super close), but she doesn’t blame me, she just said maybe I could’ve been more polite. Then today, I was at my grandma’s house with all my cousins. My aunt came to pick up her son, and I had my noise-canceling headphones on. She was standing near me saying something, and when I took them off and asked, “Sorry, were you talking to me?” she snapped, “No no no no, that would offend you, wouldn’t it?”.\n\nEvery interaction with her is just super weird now.\n\nSo, AITA?",

Leaving 2days before my birthday and will be back two days after my birthday. I lost it and tell him our child would not be going because that time was for us has a family and for him to finally spend some time with our youngest since he was just meeting her. I told him I am tired of him not setting boundaries and always sacrificing our plans to accommodate his dad. I also contacted his dad and told him I am not sending her and my reasons. And that I am tired of his sons bs and am done. Sita",

      "title": "AITA for telling my sister the reason I don't want to be an involved uncle?",
      "body": "I(36m) spent a lot of time basically raising my brother and sister. When I was 9, our parents separated for eight months. Our mother spiraled during it. She pretty much just slept when she wasn't working. My siblings at the time were 2 and 3 and I spent a lot of time with them, made sandwiches for us at dinner time, got them to bed, tuck them in, and always waking mom up or calling dad to come take care of them.\n\nThey got back together but when I was 13 dad died. Mom spiraled worse then before. She worked, slept, and was gone most the night especially on weekends. I did everything for my siblings at that point and when I was 15 I was able to work some  weekends just to help pay for extras for us. It went on like that until I was 18 and left right after graduating high school. That seemed to be the kick in the ass mom needed to get her shit together.\n\nI have since done therapy and mended my relationship with her but aftermath is I just really don't want anything to do with kids now. The thought mentally drains me. \n\nMy siblings have kids now and have wanted me to be involved since the first nibling was born 6 years ago. I don't ignore them, I show up for their parties, and I'm nice when talking to them but I don't draw out interacting with them. I don't act fake excited and I don't want to go to their events. I don't have them over my house despite them and the rest of my family always suggesting I do because they're convinced I'd be a 'fun uncle'.\n\nRecently I was picking up my camping gear from my sister's and my nephew asked to go with me and I told him no but definitely when he's older. When I was leaving my sister said I should take the kids sometimes because they're always asking about me and my stuff and suggested that she and BIL come too if it'd help. I told her no thanks. She asked why I refuse to be more present in my niblings' life because she remembers I was a lot of fun with her and our brother.\n\nI told her it mightve been fun for her but I was doing what needed to be done to keep them happy but it's okay if they remember it differently because they were so young. It's just after that I don't want to be around young kids. She dropped it. \n\nEarlier today our Nan text to tell me no one would be upset if I skipped our cookout next week so I didn't get stressed out around all the kids. Was I wrong for telling her why I don't get more involved? \n\nUpdate: Just got off the phone with Nan after I text her earlier. It was a polite disinvite due to my sister telling her I don't want to be more involved with the kids because I am kidded out after raising them. Per Nan \"It's selfish to be full of piss and vinegar over doing for family and that's not [family name] way. Your nieces and nephews need you like sister and brother did, if you can't put the bad aside you don't need to be around the kids for now. We don't always want to show up for family for whatever reason but we do it.\" I'm going to talk to my siblings, especially sis, this weekend to clear this up.",

      "title": "AITA for seemingly siding with my friend after she had a bad experience with my other friend who is a photographer?",
      "body": "I have a friend Mary, who has her own photography business. Her business page is full of five star reviews about how wonderful her work is as well as tons of glowing comments on the photos she posts. Recently another friend Rachel shared on her personal page that she had had a negative experience using Mary for family photos. She said that she was not one to complain, but that she wanted to make people aware so they didn't go through the same thing. She said she left a detailed honest review explaining why she wasn't happy and Mary responded threatening legal action if she did not remove it within 24 hours. She understandably speculated that perhaps this was why Mary had only five star reviews because she tried to shut down anyone who left negative ones. I've known Rachel several years now and she seems like an upstanding person of integrity so I assumed she was telling the truth. I commented saying that I was so sorry this happened to her and agreed that that Mary could be intimidating people into only leaving positive feedback.\n\nI went to Mary's business page to see if I could see the review for myself, but it wasn't there. Instead, I saw a post from Mary saying that Rachel had been one of \"those\" customers who straight up lied about her. She included photos she said were proof that Rachel was lying. Surprisingly she also included a screenshot of the post that Rachel had made on her personal page so apparently a mutual friend sent her a screenshot. It struck me as odd that Mary was getting so worked up over one negative review. I commented to Rachel that I had always thought that was a bad look when businesses do this. It's understandable to be disappointed by a negative review, but someone who gets downright angry and immediately blaming the customer isn't someone I'm in a hurry to do business with.\n\nI woke up the next morning though to find a private message from Mary. Apparently, not only had she seen the screenshot of Rachel's post, but she had also seen my comment. She asked why in the world I would speculate that she was intimidating people. She said that yes friends and family are very supportive of her work, but it's because they believe in her not because she's shutting down dissenting opinions. She said it wasn't very Christian of me and she had no problem unfriending me as a result. The bottom line according to her apparently was that I should've supported her because she had proof that Rachel was lying. Negative reviews could hurt her business and she didn't understand why anyone who was supposedly a friend would believe someone else against her when she had proof. Initially I figured I did nothing wrong by trying to be understanding of Rachel especially since Mary's reactions seemed over-the-top to me. Now I worry though, I messed up by getting in the middle. Perhaps I should've just kept scrolling and contacted Rachel privately given that I'm friends with both of them. AITA?",

Because of this they smell of if I regularly clean them so every couple of days I deep clean their cage and when I do I always put on headphones and dance while I’m doing it.\n\nThey are in the living room so it’s pretty visible to everyone and I guess my cousin is jealous.

I’ve tried cleaning when they are not home but it’s summer and my cousin is rarely gone.\n\nI told my aunt after she talked to me that my cousin needs to get over it because life won’t accommodate her but she said she wants her daughter to be comfortable in our house because they live there now.

      "body": "My wife and I got married 2 weeks ago. We wanted a child-free wedding so we've let everyone know my family/inlaws/friends and relatives and everyone was okay with it. Except for my family. I have 3 sisters all with kids from 2-10. My mom said it was illogical to not allow kids since (1 this never happened in the family and (2 my sisters live towns away so the kids can't be left alone. After a lot of arguing and others getting involved. I stood my ground and they agreed to not bring kids.\n\nAt the wedding no one brought kids. My parents and aunts were already there. But then I saw my 2 sisters arriving with their kids. I immediately went to ask what's the deal. They began arguing with me when I said I won't be letting them in with the kids. I saw My older sister came with her kids in the car I was pissed I asked why they decided to go against the rule and bring kids. My mom started yelling at me when I told my sisters they weren't allowed in with the kids. Everyone was yelling at me I had to get the security involved to make them leave. My parents and aunt left shortly after.\n\nThey were so pissed at me. I got nasty texts later and my cousin posted about my \"shitty wedding\" on fb.\n\nDays later. I've gathered the family and explained that what they did was wrong. I asked If I allowed my sisters with their kids what message does that send to my inlaws and friends who wanted to bring kids but they couldn't? My sisters argued with me and it turned out my mom told them to bring their kids and she'd deal with me later. I told them they could've arranged for a babysitter but my mom said they wanted to celebrate as a whole family. Said that I ruined my own wedding by making a scene. And everyone will always remember my wedding as a disaster, a shitshow because of mine and my wife's child-free bull. They said the only way to fix it is to have another wedding/party and include everyone especially kids- I called them unreasonable. I asked mom where TF she got the nerve to even demand that?. They blamed my wife and claimed it was deliberate.\n\nI left. They started talking to my wife trying to convince her that they don't approve of what happened and that they're giving us the chance to fix the situation otherwise the relationship is damaged. This caused me a headache and I don't think what I did was wrong. I just wanted them to have some respect for my wife and her family.",

      "body": "My mom died when I (17m) was 5. My dad remarried when I was 8 and made a blended family with his wife and her two kids. Then they had two kids together so I have step and half siblings. My mom's family were a big part of my life for the first 6 years and then my dad and them fought because my dad had met his wife by then and he didn't like their reaction to the news. Essentially he wanted to invite them over for my grandparents yearly family BBQ and my grandparents didn't want to include them. They told him they couldn't accept my mom's replacement. He got mad at them for feeling that's what he was doing and he told them they could forget about seeing either of us again. He tried to keep me from them but they filed for grandparents rights and dad's lawyer said they'd win so he said I could see them once every three months for 4 hours. It was way less than I was used to but it didn't stop me being close to them.\n\nHe invited them to his wedding and they didn't come. It pissed him off more and then he got super weird about it and he suddenly started demanding invites again for his wife's kids when I was invited and then when my half siblings were born, he was including them in the attempt to force my family's hands. But they never invited them. They did ask me if I wanted them there and I said not really. So they didn't change their mind. My dad always bitched about them whenever my visits would come around. He really hated that I went and my step and half siblings couldn't. He tried to tell me I should advocate for them all to be included. I never replied to him because it was easier not to.\n\nOnce I turned 14 he got worse with that stuff and he'd complain that I was calling and texting them and that I kept in touch more than the once every three months. He'd tell me they hate my siblings, that he didn't want us to have our family. I told him that didn't upset me or make me mad and it didn't change that I wanted to see them.\n\nThe day I went back to school (senior year) my dad told me since I was graduating in May and I'd be 18, he needed to make it clear that I will need to choose. Because I can't keep spending time with people who refuse to include most of my family and he told me I'll have to choose my family or \"them\". I told him the \"them\" were my family and I'd choose them. He didn't expect the answer. He got pissed and told me I should always choose siblings over extended family. Then he acted like I hadn't given my answer because he told me when he and his wife throw me the graduation party that I won't be allowed to invite my mom's side. I told him he didn't need to throw me one because they would and I'd made it clear my choice will be them. Dad told me that isn't how it works. I told him it is because he gave the ultimatum and he needs to live with the consequences. He accused me of twisting his words and disrespecting him by throwing that in his face.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. \n\nMy sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn’t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.\n\nYesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.\n\nI asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. \n\nMy sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.\n\nShe laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. \n\nSeeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.\n\nMy sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.\n\nMy nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.\n\nOther family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don’t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don’t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.\n\nThey all think I should buy another new system for him but I don’t have that kind of money. I’m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my estranged sister and our parents that she and her kids are not my problem?",
      "body": "7 years ago I was married and expecting a baby when things went horribly wrong. Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. \n\nPretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.\n\nI met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.\n\nAround three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.\n\nMy parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.\n\nAITA?",

It makes sense since most people are immature or like to stay up late. I’m 18 now. I shouldn’t be controlled like this. She even has a bedtime for me. I’m an adult. Not 12. She also doesn’t let me drive without telling her where I’m going. I also can’t spend time with friends because she’s not comfortable. I’ll need the technology for university because most assignments and resources are online. This is starting to impact my mental health. I haven’t done anything illegal or irresponsible. I even stay silent when she’s yelling at me, making me a punching bag for her. I’ve never yelled at her, never said anything mean. I’m tired of being controlled. I can’t even move out because she doesn’t trust me or think I’m responsible. I could just hide my laptop and phone at night so she can’t find it until morning, but it might strain our relationship. I’ve tried talking to her, but she just won’t understand. I don’t know what to do anymore. ",

      "body": "Update!! First I want to thank everyone for their comments and support. If feels wonderful to have you all behind me on this. Well where to start. My sister has gone to my whole family regarding this matter and twisted it. I am so not shocked about this. Yesterday was her and her husbands 1 yr wedding anniversary. I sent them a group text ( I have no issues with him) and surprise he was the only one that responded. I was talking to family regarding this and found out a few more things. She thinks that because she helped me co sign a loan for to get a new water heater that she should be allowed to have her party at me house. Yes I know I had to finance my water heater which sucks but when you have 2 kids and your savings took a hit due to car repairs you do what ya gotta do. But that alone gives her the thoughts that she should get what she wants. I put a group message out to my family about my son's senior prom and that we are doing pictures. Even though I am not speaking with them my son has a right to have them there and take a wild guess. No response. If she takes this out on my son then that will forever be the end of our relationship.\n\nThanks again for everyones comments\n\nAITA I 36 female have a sister 34 that is calling me selfish and rude for not allowing her to have her baby sprinkle at my home. For some background my sister and I have a love hate relationship. She is my mother’s golden child. I do not get along with my mother but that’s for a whole other post. My sister always had things handed to her and due to that she has become entitled. Now to the point of this post. My husband and I have opened our home for parties and gatherings for friends and family. Events such as our kid’s birthday parties to hosting a surprise engagement for 2 of our friends to allowing my sister to use it as a “hall” for her gender reveal last month. The issue is that after the reveal I realized that her guests broke my vegetable garden box by sitting on it allowed their kids to mess up my garden and left a mess in my house. My husband and I decided that was the last time. Jump to today. My sister wants to have her sprinkle at my home once she found out I wasn’t paying for her to have it anywhere due to funds. Which kinda pissed me off. So in her mind I won’t pay for her and her guests to eat and be merry somewhere so she can use my house to have it knowing the kind of host I am. When I told her no that my house was not an option she started being nasty to me. Telling me that I was punishing her for others actions and that she’s my sister and it’s not right. She went as far as trying to guilt me by saying that I don’t care about her and the baby and for me to have a good life. I’m stressing her out. And she regrets asking me and this is why she doesn’t ask for help. She doesn’t want to understand my feelings and reasons. So am I wrong for not wanting a bunch of people here again that disrespected my home before?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my roommate I won’t won’t pay for her meals any more",
      "body": "I (21f) live with 3 roommates (4 of us in total) in a house we’re renting for college. The whole situation has been extremely agreeable as we made extensive plans for who would be paying what, and situations for after the house was paid off, all in all a great deal for all 4 of us. We also make dinner plans very easy as the day before we pick where to go and who all will be paying. \n\nOne of my roommates, Kate (21f), however, has been acting rather strange and frankly annoying about our eating out. Whenever only 1 person is paying for all of our meals it’s usually for a special occasion or just something small like fast food, well Kate takes advantage of that and will pick out things she know no one else will eat and order a LOT, that’s not the main issue tho, the issue is that she’ll only eat a couple bites then bring the rest home then proceed to NOT EAT THE LEFT OVERS. It was really getting on all of our nerves.\n\nOne  day I wanted to take every one out to celebrate making it through the school year so I took us somewhere nice (an awfully expensive place for even one person might I add) Kate did her usual shenanigans and ordered 2 different dinner items and an appetizer, she took a couple bites of each, then said she was full. I was pissed but I ignored it so we could have a good night. \n\nWell now it’s dinner time the next day and she hasn’t eaten anything from her left overs so I go to her and tell her that because it was expensive I expect her to either eat her leftovers by dinner tomorrow or pay me back for her portion of the meal (I save my receipts for tax purposes so I knew her portion was around $70) she got mad and said that it was rude to ask for that when I offered to pay in the first place. I then told her that if that was the case I just wouldn’t be paying for her meals anymore, I’d pay for the others but not hers. She got mad, screamed at me and stormed out to go spend the night at her bf’s apartment. This was a few days ago and she’s still bitter to me now.\n\nI feel like I was setting a rightful boundary but I’m typically a people pleaser so I can’t tell if I was actually being rude. AITAH?\n\nEDIT: not sure why so many people think this is a fake story? Yes we’re in college but we were all raised to be reasonable and responsible adults so we know how yo save money properly. We know how to save money so that things like treating our friends to a nice meal aren’t hard, but since so many people seem to have an issue with this post let me clarify some things \n1. We don’t eat out EVETY night. We eat out on special occasions, get fast food, or most days we cook at home. Eating out too often is a waste of food\n2. Her portion was $70 because she got so much food, everyone else’s was a reasonable price for what I was expecting.\n3. I only let her order that cause she had been raving about how hungry she was that night and how she “had been dying to try this place”\n4. I had been saving a little bit and had just gotten paid and wanted to treat my friends to celebrate being a year closer to graduation\n5. This house situation was YEARS in the making, we’ve all known each other since sophomore year of high school and we’re now juniors in college (nearly 4 years)\n6. I’m not disclosing our plans for the house but yes, we have long term plans for how the house will be paid off and who will stay at the house and (legally speaking) own it\n7. Most of us get a couple hundred from a parents every couple months to help with expenses, I will not be disclosing who doesn’t get that, only that Kate does so you all know money isn’t an issue for her. Yes we’re are very lucky to have that support, I can’t speak for all of my roommates but my money from my parents goes to my emergency fund\n8. Kate’s food wasting issue was usually not an actual issue as it had never been this much food or money wasted and it’s not often that 1 person offers to pay for everyone \n9. No Kate does not show any and has not ever shown signs of having disordered eating. Her bf is not being rude to her about her weight, nor are we. Without getting too in depth, I have past experience with an ED and can say with confidence that she shows NONE of the tell tale signs of any of them, if I suspected she had one I would’ve NEVER told her she needed to eat the leftovers and just would’ve asked for her to pay me back\n10. I find it funny I have to say this, but this post isn’t AI generated lol it’s genuinely just me (an extreme people pleaser) not knowing if I crossed a line",

      "body": "This happened a few months ago, but my brain won't let this one go.\n\nSo I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said \"Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become.\" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.\n\nNow, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking \"how me and my dick knows about that\". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole \"women get looser\" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: \"Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining.\"\n\nSo I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?",

      "title": "AITA for scolding my struggling sister when she gives us grief about adopting a baby?",
      "body": "My sister (35f) and her husband (37m) have been struggling with infertility since they got married 12 years ago. They've tried absolutely everything, from medical to spiritual, but unfortunately, nothing works. Now that she's approaching late 30s, they're starting to look into adoption, but it's also been a slow going, since their financial condition isn't exactly stable from multiple rounds of fertility treatments they went through. I can only imagine the struggle, and I sympathize with her, but the stress this situation is bringing her and her husband honestly puts a strain on our relationship.\n\nMy husband and I (both 30) lost our best friends, Mason and his wife, Kate, two weeks ago in a horrible car accident. They left behind their son Pete, who isn't even two yet. It was so sudden and so heart-wrenching. We're still grieving, which lowers out contact with a lot of people, including my sister and BIL. Our main concern right now is ourselves and Pete, whose custody has come to us because we're both his godparents, actively engaged in Pete's life since his birth, and because Mason and Kate have neither left a Will nor have immediate living relatives who can take him in.\n\nWe've decided to adopt Pete as soon as we can stomach the process. My husband and I never planned on having kids, and even if we did, this is absolutely not the way we want to go about it. The situation is far from ideal, but we're starting the adoption process yesterday, for Pete's safety if nothing else. We broke the news to our extended families and friends, letting them know that my husband and I won't be very available for a little longer because of this.\n\nI know my sister and BIL will have something to say about this. I'm prepared for a few heated text messages or voice mails. However, I didn't expect them to turn up on our doorstep, crying about how \"unfair\" it is that we were given everything they wanted, and how we didn't deserve to be parents because we didn't go through what they had to. I've never seen my husband so angry before. He's usually very mild and gentle, but recent events have stretched our patience to the limits. We kicked them off of our porch, and I told my sister before she left that since our pain inconveniences her so much, I won't have her around me and my family at all anymore.\n\nI know she made a fuss about it, and now everyone has something to say to us. We turned off our phones, so we don't know which ones are cursing us and which one aren't. I know some did/are. My husband and I are both in pain and grieving, and we can't trust ourselves to be objective. Did we go to far?\n\nEdit: I originally did not want to put this information in, because I don't want everyone to point at it and say this is the reason we're not in the wrong. For the sake of disclosure: My husband and I are both men. No, this is not a case of homophobia. My sister, for all her fault, was the first person to accept me for who I love, and I will not hear a single word about this in the comment. ",

      "body": "I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. \n\nRecently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. \n\nI know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. \n\nSo I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. \n\nAnyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. \n\nNow I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

      "body": "My wife (40F) and I (39M) have been married for 12 years and have 2 kids (9 & 7).  We both work full time, but I have got promoted about 3 months ago that required a change to my work hours.  I used to have the same standard M-F hours as my wife.  But my new role has me working 10-hour shifts Thursday-Sunday.  This promotion came with a pretty substantial pay raise as well.  My wife and I discussed how my change in hours would affect our family's day-to-day lives, but we both agreed it would be worth it for the additional income.  \n\nI use my time off on Monday-Wednesday to do pretty much all the family shopping, errands, cleaning, laundry, and have even been able to make substantial progress on some long put-off home projects.  I also cook dinners and prep weekly lunches for the kids and my wife.  The additional income is becoming noticeable as well as we haven't had this much in our savings account in years.  \n\nA few weeks ago, my wife started griping about my new job.  She hates that I am working all weekend because that means she's with the kids the whole time.  She complains that she goes from working all week to solo-parenting on weekends.  Both our kids are in activities on weekends so she has been doing that by herself as well.  \n\nWe talked about ways to ease some of the weekend stuff from her such as getting a babysitter, carpooling to kids' activities, taking the kids to their grandparents, etc.  But she still complains that all of the leg work for those things will be done by her because I'm at work.  She said she feels like she never has any time for herself since my hours got changed.  \n\nTo try and alleviate this, I suggested that she make plans with friends to do something on Monday or Tuesday nights.  She tried but got frustrated when her friends were busy those nights and wanted to get together on weekends.  This led to another argument with her telling me that she hates my new job and that I need to look into changing my hours again.\n\nI told her that I have been trying everything to help ease the transition with my new job but all I've been met with is hostility and frustration.  I asked her if there was anything more I could do other than change my hours and she told me, \"No.\"  She said she just hates that she doesn't get a break and that I have 3 days to myself.  \n\nI started listing off all the ways I have been trying to make this easier and how much more money we are making and she cut me off and said the money isn't worth it.  I got frustrated and told her if she needs time for herself, she should just use vacation time from work if she's not going to be reasonable and help me find a compromise.\n\nShe got even more mad and told me I am being an AH.  She made me sleep in the guest room and told me that I can't come back to our bed unless I \"fix this.\"",

      "body": "Update at the bottom \n\nThrowaway and usual mobile formatting apologies. \n\nI 32(f) and a Gemologist, I spend my days in the lab testing and identifying stones. From the nature of my work I also have a large and valuable collection of jewellery but also gem specimens that I keep in a safe I specifically bought and had installed to keep them safe. I also have a second smaller safe for keeping important documents like passports. \n\nI own my home and my boyfriend (33m) of 2 years recently moved in as he was renting before. I gave him the code to the smaller safe so he could put valuables in it, but he also wants the code for my gem safe. Not to put anything in it, but he says because we are living together now I should trust him and give him the code. I’ve said no because he has no reason to open the safe as the only thing it’s used for is storing my collection, he’s said he has no interest in my gem collection, doesn’t want to look at them, but still wants the code to access them. \n\nThis is causing tension because he says I should give it to him as a show of trust, and I said no, because he literally has no reason to go in there so he doesn’t need the code. This is a 6 figure collection so I’m not being difficult over a few little gems here. I am the only one who knows the code. \n\nSo Reddit am I being TA here? \n\n*also we are in the UK so we spell jewellery differently to the US\n\nEdit: holy hell this blew up way more than I ever expected! Im sticking to my guns and I’m not giving him the code. All you lovely internet strangers are right, it’s a huge marinara flag and I’ll be telling him to pack his stuff. I’ll update you later. Thank you all for your comments!!\n\nEdit 2: this keeps coming up, the safe weighs nearly half a ton, it’s bolted to the floor and wall and is from a company who make safes, vaults and strong rooms for jewellers. You could bring the house down around it and it would still be intact.\n\nFinal edit: I think I have phrased it badly but all of the gems and jewellery in the safe are mine and mine alone. I do not keep any clients jewellery at home. For my other business doing valuations I rent a separate space and keep client items there. \n\nI will give an update once things have panned out\n\nAnother edit: I’ve checked for cameras (thank you for the suggestions people) and there aren’t any aside from the ones I already have fitted which he doesn’t have access to. I’ve moved all of my personal docs out of the little safe and into my gem safe. I’ve told my colleague what I’m doing and she is going to come around for when I do it. \n\nUpdate: \n\nFirstly thank you so much for the insane amount of comments and support, it meant so much to me.  For all of your messages and questions I’m really sorry if I didn’t get to you there were just so many! \n\nI probably didn’t emphasise in my last post that we had a couple of conversations about this and me explaining why he had no reason to go in there etc. \n\nShort version is I told him he isn’t getting the code and I will die on this hill. He has no reason to have it and his continued lack of respect by the pushing of my boundaries wasn’t ok, I felt like he was trying to manipulate me by making it about trust.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth he finally admitted that he wanted access to the safe because he didn’t feel like I was sharing the whole house with him, because I insisted on a tenancy agreement rather than just letting him move in, and he didn’t like that part of where he lived was off limits to him. He was also insecure and resented that  I have more money than him and own a home whilst he doesn’t, he had made a few comments about this before but I didn’t realise it was such a big issue for him. He also said that by keeping him out of the safe made him feel like I thought he was lesser than me and that it made him feel like I was treating him like a child. \n\nI told him if that’s how he feels then this is not the right relationship for either of us and that it was best we break up. He was shocked that I was ending things over this, cried and asked me to reconsider, when I said no he then got angry, called me a stuck up b*tch said he was better off without me anyway and went to his friends. I told him via text he had 30 days before he had to leave (as per the tenancy agreement) so he didn’t need to stay at a friends, he said he would be gone by the end of the week. 2 days later he came back and packed up all of his stuff and left, he’s staying with his friend now. \n\nI have changed all the locks, I have an alarm and cctv system that’s professionally monitored and I have changed the verbal password I have to give when you call up as a precaution. I’ve checked all of my collection and it hasn’t been touched. I also took your guys advice and am giving my solicitor the code and safe deposit details to be passed to my executor in the event of my death. \n\nI feel horrible because despite all of this I love him, but lot’s of the comments said how I should have a partner who not only respects my boundaries but takes an interest in my passions and that really got to me because it’s true, so may of you reached out with questions and it made me so happy, but also sad as he never asked me stuff like that, I think this is what pushed me over the edge to end it more than anything. \n\nI’m pretty cut up right now and missing him, but I know I’ll be ok, I have great friends and family around me, also diamonds are a girls best friend and I have a few knocking around to help cheer me up!",

      "title": "WIBTA for not sharing the stuff our grandmother left us with my middle sister",
      "body": "So to clarify. I (22 F) am the oldest between my sisters. For the story lets call my little sister (20) L and my middle sister (21) M. \n\nSo 3 years ago the great grandmother of my stepfather died. Her whole funeral was alot of trouble and headaches for my mother's side of the family, but that is not important for the story. At the end each of us got a piece of jewelry. L and I put ours away safely while M used hers to make posts on her social media. But just after a week she already lost her piece of jewelry which made her mad cause now only I and L had one and she didn't which was unfair in her eyes. \n\nThat was a scheme that she had since we were kids. She gets something, breaks or loses it and then gets mad at us. A handmade handbag. Torn apart. A necklace. Broken. And so on. I of course kept my stuff safe from her because I knew that she often takes my stuff and then claims that it was actually hers and I just remember it wrong.\n\nNow to the current situation. Last year the apartment of my mother needed to be emptied cause her lease ended. The only ones left living inside the apartment were M and my brother. My mother gave me the go ahead to enter the apartment and take everything I needed. She also made the offer available to everyone else. L couldn't come by cause the lived to far way by now and M refused to, cause she didn't want to search all the items she might need or want. I was at first confused about her reasoning but when I entered the apartment I saw why. Garbage and filth everywhere. The kitchen was a biohazard. The bedrooms of M and my brother a catastrophe and the living room was just bad. I luckily got my bf and his sisters to help me work through all that stuff to find items that we could still safe. Meanwhile M and my brother just glarred at us. \n\nIn the end we found old items from my grandmother from my mother's side of the family. All pieces were handmade by her and they were still in a very good shape. M got offered to have some pieces too but she didn't want any. It was to much of a hastle for her to get everything to her new home and also she didn't want that handmade stuff. So I took everything to my place where I put it inside a showcase to keep it safe. (For info: my brother had no interest in the pieces too)\n\nNow a few months later she suddenly shows more and more interest in the pieces and wants some too. But I see no point in giving her any. 1. She will just lose them or break them again. 2. Everytime she gets a sentimental item she uses it to make sad posts on her social media before throwing it away so it can collect dust 3. She was too idle to fish out the stuff from the garbage but now that I have them all lined up inside my showcase the hastle of collecting them suddenly vanished. Imo she had her chance.\n\n  \nSo WIBTA for not giving her any of the pieces I got from our grandmother?",

      "title": "AITA for telling a neighbour she can't expect only old people to live in our street?",
      "body": "I moved into my house about 2/3 years ago. I'm 30 (look 20) with a family. It's also a british town and my house is semi detached in a street of terraced houses.\n\nI'm quite the introvert so apart from my direct neighbours I really made no attempt at getting to know the rest around my house. That being said, if someone speaks to me I will happily speak to them.\n\nCue to the incident, a OAP came up to me while I was taking stuff to my car and she started asking questions. The usual stuff you ask new neighbours but then she asked me when I planned on moving which I thought was quite unusual. I told her I had no plans to move yet and then she went on to talk about how young people have started moving into the street and it is much so noisy, especially those with families (She knew I have kids but they barely spend any time outside) and how she wished it went back to a street of old people.\n\nFor about 10 minutes there was nothing but low key insults about young people. I couldn't really excuse myself as I had stuff to do with my car that was time sensitive.\n\nSo in the end I just said\n\n\"You can't expect only old people to live in a street, eventually they grow old and die. Maybe wait a few years and we'll be old and you'll have your street back if you're still around.\"\n\nShe looked at me as if I just murdered her family and walked off. In the heat of the moment I felt justified but thinking back on it, I pretty much told her she will be dead soon which no one really likes hearing. She just wouldn't stop talking about the good old times.",

      "title": "AITA for only going out to eat with my uncle after the rest of my family disagreed with my restaurant choice?",
      "body": "I (F21) am currently living with my uncle and his family while I attend university. In my family it's tradition for everyone to invite out their family for their birthday. The person celebrating their birthday pays.\n\nMy birthday was yesterday and luckily restaurants here have already opened up. About a week in advance I chose a Moroccan couscous restaurant and made a reservation. I briefly mentioned it to the rest of the family at dinner but I don't think most of them were listening.\n\nTwo days ago I reminded everybody where we were going. Everybody except for my uncle started to complain about the choice. My extremely picky cousin (17) apparently hates Moroccan food, even though I don't think he's ever tried it. My aunt is uncomfortable with going to \"that kind\" of restaurant (?). My other cousin (26) is a vegan and didn't think he would be able to eat a lot of things, and his girlfriend didn't want to eat there because she's on a raw food diet. My other cousin is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.\n\nIt didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. They asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that I don't really like. I refused and said they just didn't have to come.\n\nOnly my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which I'm happy about because I know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. It was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. \n\nNow the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually include the whole family, and they think it's inconsiderate of us to have eaten without them. I think it's their fault for not even wanting to try it. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your judgements. I saw a lot of people confused about paying when it's your birthday. Where I'm from it's the custom, not just in my family but everywhere. I think it's a nice custom. That way no guest worries about not being able to pay, and it's nice to be able to pay for family and friends to have a nice meal.",

      "body": "I (28F) live with my fiancé (31M) in a rented apartment in the city center. It's 75 square meters, modern, in a good location, and 15 minutes by bike to work – perfect for us. My parents can't understand this. For them, paying rent is ”money down the drain.\" According to them, you have to own a house, otherwise you're not a real adult, and of course, we need a house for the kids. Because apparently, kids cannot survive in a rental appartement. We do not even have kids, but we would like to in the future. We are not trying currently though.\n\nNow the part where I might be the asshole:\n\nWe had a huge argument over dinner at the weekend. My father had found a nice house on the countryside, not far from their place. A friend of his wanted to sell it and he would give it to us at a very reduced price (it was truly cheap, but I didn't see the condition of the house), because he is lifelong friends with my father and \"young people should move back to the countryside to keep it alive\". But we don't want a house right now, we want to stay flexible and independent. We also do not want to move to the countryside, cause everything is literally DEAD there. There is nothing after 7 PM, no supermarkets are open, no buses run. I love going out for dinner or to the movies or maybe just to a nice café that is open late or a bar. But my mother just says, “When you have children, you'll want a house and a garden anyway. Kids don't thrive in a concrete jungle! You're acting completly egoistic. Your father tried so hard to get that offer so low!”\n\nThe complete disregard of my and my fiancés perspective on life made me burst. I got loud, I cried and I left.\n\nMy parents now act as if I am lazy or irresponsible just because we do not want to buy a random house in a village at the end of the world. However, we are saving money, have reserves, and could theoretically buy in a few years if prices change. We could buy a house we would really want then.\n\nI really feel bad for shouting at my parents and for running away, but I really had to get out. I haven't spoken to them since, but they keep messaging me (despite my fiancé telling them, that we need time to discuss the matter).\n\nAITA because I do not want to buy a cheap house?",

      "body": "\nMy sister (20) got out of a terrible relationship and moved in with me and my husband and brought her 5 months old son, she's dealing with a handful of issues from ppd to depression. I asked my husband if he'd be okay with her moving in and he said absolutely, not just this but he was the one who picked her/brought her home.\n\n\nShe stayed for 2 weeks and helped around the house, My husband started complaining about the baby crying but a newborn is expected to cry especially at night. He said it causes him stress although I suggested he put on earbuds. He suddenly told me to forget it and so I did.\n\nLast week, I had to go out of town to attend a friend's funeral without my husband, He said he wanted to stay with my sister to make sure she's okay. I returned home the next day and didn't find her or her baby home. My husband said she contacted a friend in another town and wanted to move with them and left that morning, he handed me a letter he claimed was from her. This felt so odd...especially after reading the letter, I called her phone many many times but turned out my husband found it and said she must've left it behind. I was worried I had no means of contacting her to make sure she was okay, I contacted relatives but they knew nothing.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from an unknown number and it was her, we talked and she told me that she didn't leave on her own but my husband kicked her out after telling her that she was no longer welcome, and she needed to take responsibility for her decisions. I was in shock as she explained that she's not with a friend but at a shelter and she has no money. I waited til he got home and I blew up at him, he admitted he faked the letter an hid her phone then argued that it's his house to and he has a say, but he shouldn't have lied to me about my sister and causing her to be homeless. I he said I was being unfair and wrong to lash out at him for wanting peace in his home. I went upstairs and refused to argue anymore. I told him I'm going to pick her up tomorrow and he said he'd change the locks while I'm gone and I won't be allowed to bring her home. I'm thinking of going to a hotel but he kept saying that I'm letting my sister affect our lives by prioritizing her but there's a baby involved, my nephew and I can't leave him homeless. I get that it's house too but I don't see why he's so against her staying.\n\n\nEdit:- he returned home and we started arguing again, I couldn't take it anymore I'm going to stay at a hotel for tonight am I'm leaving in an hour or so. He is wanting to talk again now but I'm incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out and need some time by myself. I don't care if he's going to change the locks or not I'm working on meeting up with my sister as soon as possible so we can talk more openly about what happened and hopefully try and figure something out.",

      "body": "My fiancé (27F) and I (30M) bought an apartment last year. We spent about 6 months and a lot of money to get the apartment ready and habitable. In the last few weeks we've been finishing up the bigger parts of the apartment: having a workable kitchen installed, a bedroom, internet, and those kinds of things. Recently we ticked off one of the last holding points preventing us from moving in, that is having a washing machine and dryer installed.\n\nBefore having the washer and dryer actually installed (when we were given the installation date), I had already started moving over some non essential items like winter clothes and some small souvenirs/collectables. She, on the other hand, has not moved a thing yet from her stuff. For context, both of us live separately; her with her parents, and me with mine. \n\nRecently I brought up that once it is habitable, I am planning to move in. She seemed to be taken aback by this, saying that it is OUR place and we should move in together. While I do agree with her that it is our home, I don't really see anything wrong with moving in before her, as it would also allow me to help her move in.\n\nCurrently she is unable to move as she has a lot of pending deadlines this month related to her studies and between work and her studies, she is barely having any time to herself, let alone getting ready to pack up all her stuff and move.\n\nWhile I understand her wanting to move in together, I am very unhappy in my current living situation and cannot wait to get out of here. She gets upset at the thought of living in our apartment by myself without her there. On the other hand, I just can't stand the thought of having a \"ready to move into\" apartment and not being able to move in just because she gets upset at not moving in at the same time.\n\nI'm torn on whether I should insist on moving without her and wait for her there, or if I should just wait it out a bit longer until she is in a position to be able to move. She also has not provided a date or a general idea of when she would be able to move, which also concerns me a bit.\n\nWIBTA if I insist on moving in when I am ready and packed up everything?",

So we bought the house as a second home, we live in NJ and commute into Manhattan for work.  We figured that he would have a place to live and we could visit every so often and spend some quality time together. \n\nWe pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.  \n\nNow for the problem: The wedding !!! \n\nWe hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fiancé and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fiancé go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fiancé along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told \"We're not their kind of people\".  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.  \n\nI let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fiancé.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale. \n\nThey call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted. \n\nAm I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.  He is my son but thein-laws seem to take over and we no longer count.",

      "body": "I (22F) have a daughter turning 1 this week. I recently started working again, but before that, I was unemployed and surviving off inheritance money from my late father, who was a landowner. It’s not a steady income, but I’d get rent payments here and there. I used some of that money to start lending out small loans at 20% interest. Over time, I turned $700 into over $7,000, which became our main support since my boyfriend (23M) doesn’t have a job.\n\nHe used to work but was fired for signing in and leaving early. He fishes, so food isn’t the issue — I cover everything else, including our baby’s needs. I’d been saving as much as I could for her birthday.\n\nWhere I'm from, we can apply for financial help from MPs. If accepted, they'd give you a task and pay you when it’s done — we call it a “bid.” My boyfriend got two: one for $3,000 (meant for the party), and another for $1,000 (which he said was for himself).\n\nHe gave half of the $3,000 to his mom to “lightly” shop for food, even though we only needed a few things. I was covering all the other expenses: decorations, clothes, etc. I had also lent him over $2,000 over time, even after telling him I couldn’t anymore. He promised to pay me back once he got the second bid. When I asked for it, he told me to “mind my own business” and that I already had my own money.\n\nI’m furious because I sacrificed so much to save for this party while he acts like money isn’t a problem. Now I’m short, he’s refusing to repay me, and I’m left to figure everything out alone.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "body": "my friend (33m) has recently become friends with my partner (29m) and both unfortunately found themselves unemployed at the same time. my partner has since found a new job, just waiting to start. everyday my friend calls my partner to play call of duty and they play online for hours at a time. they first started playing around 9/10pm and it’s slowly gotten earlier and earlier. now they start gaming from about 6pm onwards. my friend texts asking to game and my partner never says no and says he doesn’t enjoy playing game alone. \n\nmy issue : we have a child together and my partners gaming routine is apparent enough that our child says “dads gonna wake up and go back on game again”. when our child asks to play games, interact and be social my partner tends to avoid it, reschedule or bypass it completely but as soon as my friend texts .. he’s setting up to play game. \n\nnaturally you’d think surely you can all just spend time together in the daytime .. nope. my partner sleeps more or less all day because he’s gamed all night (often till about 5/6am in the morning). when he does eventually arise from his slumber .. he’ll cook dinner, potter about a bit, scroll on his phone and wait for my friend to text. i’ve noticed my partner initiates texts asking to game now too. \n\ni’ve mentioned it to both my friend and partner hoping for understanding and some kind of moderation and nothing has changed. it’s almost as though i’m getting in the way of their time together. \n\njust now; i was talking to our child about going to sleep and my partner was on the phone to my friend just about to come off a call. they’d planned to start gaming together in the next 15mins. my friend then called my partner back asking if he overheard me asking my partner to go to bed and said “no no, you tell her you can’t go to bed we’re gaming” . i think it was cheeky and rude for him to question. whether i was talking to my partner or not (i wasn’t) it isn’t his business and so what if their gaming plan changed for the night?!? \n\nat first it was nice but now it’s grating on me. it’s every single day. am i being silly?\n\nUPDATE:\nafter a night of gaming our day has just begun. the phone rings and surprise surprise it’s my friend. he called me because my partner missed his call. i declined his call and he called my partner again! \n\nalso bits i missed out\n1. our child is 10\n2. i’m pregnant with debilitating HG morning sickness\n\nthank you for the answers i really appreciate them as they give clarity x",

      "title": "AITA for cancelling the entire vacation when I found out that my stepdaughters deliberately hid my daughter's passport to get her to stay home?",
      "body": "I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\nEditing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

      "title": "AITA for walking out of the bridal salon when I found out my friends were making fun of me behind my back? ",
      "body": "I have two friends: Gaby and Shelly. All of us are 23, if that matters. We were roommates in college and stayed in the same city after graduation. While the three of us are close, I’ve always known that Gaby and Shelly are the closest. They have a really sweet friendship.\n \nShelly is getting married. Gaby is the maid of honor and I’m one of the bridesmaids. Over the weekend, I went with Shelly so she could look at wedding dresses. Gaby was supposed to come with us but got called into work last minute. I helped Shelly pick out some dresses then she went with the consultant to try them on. Shelly asked that I take pictures and videos on her phone to send to her mom and Gaby. I was getting the camera ready when a text from Gaby came through. I didn’t mean to click on it and was instantly going to click back out when I saw one of my Instagram pictures in their private chat from earlier that morning. Both were making fun of me for the face I was making and my outfit choice. It didn’t appear to be very good nature.\n \nI admit, curiosity got the best of me so I searched my name in the chat. I found multiple pictures that I, my boyfriend or my mom have posted of myself, absolutely ripping them to shreds. Ranging from selfies to posed shots to even a few baby pictures. They’d also make fun of me in general in terms of the way I talked, wore my hair and the way I ate. This went back as far as I could tell, at least a year.\n \nMy heart broke. It all felt so juvenile and high school. While we all joke around, I would never do this to them nor have they ever even tried to instigate these types of conversations with me about the other one on one. I was in tears. As someone who was bullied all through middle and high school, it just brought me back to a horrible place. I put the phone in Shelly’s purse and brought it to another employee, telling her to tell Shelly that I had to go. I drove home and had a long cry.\n \nShelly texted me by the time I made it home asking where I went. I said I was going home and we could talk later. When she did call a few hours later, she was understandably confused and hurt that I left. I told her what I found, explaining that I only looked further because of the initial text I accidentally saw. She went off on me for looking through her private texts and said those were none of my business. She also told me I shouldn’t have left the store without saying anything. I said I didn’t want to make a scene but also knew I couldn’t fake being happy for her.\n \nShelly told me the texts were “all in good fun” and clearly she loves me because I’m going to be her bridesmaid. She added that I’m only hurt because I chose to read all those texts. Later on, Gaby called to tell me that I invaded Shelly’s privacy and hurt her by walking out.\n \nMy boyfriend and mom think I did the right thing by walking out. But obviously, they’re a little biased. I just want some unbiased looks: was I an asshole to look through the texts and then leave?\n\n",

We are paying completely for our portion of the vacation and will have separate hotel rooms. I’m a Disney adult. I love Disney! I’m so excited to be able to take my toddler! It’s extremely special for me since I’ve been going since I was his age. \n\n My very controlling MIL has been asking for a family vacation and for some reason because I can’t say no I told her that her and my FIL can join. They aren’t Disney people and are purely coming to have family time. My MIL is very bossy and controlling and will just take my son from me and not let me enjoy any of the social moments with him. I brought up to my husband that I’d like some nuclear family time. He says that I’m wrong for just bringing them to Disney and leaving them there when they don’t even like Disney and are coming just for family time. AITA?  ",

      "body": "So, my (26F) parents decided to name my sister and I after American states. I have permission to share her name (Arizona) and I was called Pennsylvania at birth. Yea, my parents are weird. I guess they thought geographical names were cool but I think there’s a huge difference between calling your child Arizona or Dakota or Paris Vs Pennsylvania. They’re massive republicans and America lovers so maybe they wanted to be patriotic. \n\nFor as long as I can remember, everyone has called me Penn or Penny. My parents insisted that everyone was to call me by my full name but most people could see how ridiculous my parents are. \n\nMy sister (28F) didn’t struggle as much with her name since Arizona just sounds better than Pennsylvania, and the Greys anatomy character Arizona Robbins made the name seem quite cool as we got older. I was mocked and teased as a child in elementary school because of my parents insistence on my full name. They would literally berate my teachers for letting me write ‘Penny’ on my work/books.\n\nWhen I was 21, I got my name legally changed to Penelope. Most people I had met in college had assumed that I went by Penny as a nickname for Penelope, even my boyfriend’s mother called me Penelope because I was too embarrassed to tell her that Penny was short for Pennsylvania. I kept it a secret from my parents and close family because I knew my parents would go mental and accuse me of disrespecting their choice.\n\nI’m getting married this summer to my lovely boyfriend Tom (31M) and as you all know, you have to say your full name in your wedding ceremony when doing your vows. I knew I had to fess up about the name change because the alternative would be hoping they kept quiet when they heard me say ‘I, Penelope’ instead of ‘I, Pennsylvania’.\n\nI invited them over to my home and I tried to tell them in a really calm way that I had changed my name but they freaked out. They said that I was disrespectful, I was calling their choice dumb etc. They are refusing to attend the wedding now.\n\n\nI know i’m not the AH for changing my name, but my parents are particularly pissed about how I kept it hidden for five years before telling them. Most people I know agree with them. They think that I should’ve had the courage to be honest with them years ago so they would’ve had time to get used to it instead of me dropping the news on them two months before my wedding and causing all this drama. A few other family members have dropped out and my poor sister (who is maid of honor) is having a nightmare with this. My parents believe they had the right to know much earlier.\n\nTldr, parents think I am the AH for keeping this a secret. AITA?\n\nEdit: I know I could ask the officiant/priest to say Penny instead of Penelope but I don’t want to hide my real name on my wedding day.",

      "body": "While on vacation, my family went on a tour to an island. On the way there, we sat in the upper deck of the boat and all got very seasick. When we got to the island, some people took all their belongings, while others left theirs on their seats.\n\nDuring lunch, we found seats with no belongings on them, so we sat there and stayed until the boat ride back. Then the family who was previously sitting there came back, and since we were occupying the seats, they took nearby reserved seats for a VIP group that paid for extras for this tour. The VIP family asked the other family to move out of their reserved seats, so they asked us to give them back their seats.\n\nThe crew explained that non-reserved seats were free for all if you didn't leave your belongings there. The crew politely asked us if we'd be willing to give up the seats, but we were within our rights to stay there. We said we preferred to sit in the lower deck on the journey back to avoid the seasickness again. The father of the the family got very angry, demanded his seats back and threatened to stay back on the island if he didn't. He expected to keep their seats and blamed the crew for not informing them that the seats were not reserved for them.\n\nThe crew ultimately let that family sit in the VIP seats since the man was furious, and offered the VIP family free drinks to move seats. Everyone involved was offered some freebies for compensation. It took the crew a while to resolve the situation, and they said it's never happened before.\n\nI overheard some people critical of us for not moving, even though the crew said we didn't do anything wrong and that the man's behavior was unacceptable.

Because I know sh\\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't.\n\nWell, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?",

      "body": "I know the title sounds bad please hear me out\n\nSo I have severe epilepsy and have a service dog Onyx. Now Onyx does have time to cuddle and relax and be at rest and just be a dog. But when he is working he is WORKING at keeping me alive. He's saved my life multiple times\n\nNow my friend has been coming over a lot recently to visit. I love her but have an issue with her husband. He's one of those types who harbors the believe that have a dick makes him superior to women. He also doesn't believe in invisible disabilities and because of Onyx he's never seen me have a seizure.\n\nLast week they came over and her husband was being playful with Onyx which was fine as he was at rest. A little while later though the husband began asking if he could dogsit sometime bring Onyx to their place for a sleepover. I said no and explained AGAIN that Onyx is a service dog and I needed him to ya know...... Stay alive. Her husband got an attitude and told me Onyx wasn't a machine and I had no right to deprive him of fun. Then he pulled the I'm a man so I know more than you card by explaining that I was wrong and he was right and I could go one night without onyx and control my seizures. All this time my friend sat on the couch saying nothing. \n\nI asked him to leave and after some huffing and puffing about how rude I am and what happened to manners and Onyx would've had fun they both did.\n\nNow today my friend called asking if they could stop by. I explained that I would love to have her over but her husband was no longer welcome. She got upset and told me that he was just like that and it was hard to tell sometimes because he had never seen me have a full blown seizure. I got kinda mad and sarcastically asked her if I should purposely cause a seizure so her husband was comfortable. She just kept repeating that he meant no harm and wanted Onyx to have fun. I just told her again that she is welcome but he is not.\n\nAITA. I feel awful and feel like I'm creating an issue but that man is just toxic energy and I worry that his disbelief of my need for a service animal will cause him to do something completely crazy.\n\n\nEdit. I had to work with Onyx for two weeks at a training center before I could even bring him home so he knew exactly how to help me i.e read my body and triggers and so we worked together and we're completely in synch. He's extremely well trained and I feel like that might have something to do with this.",

      "body": "A new co-worker started 3 months ago. Let’s call her Linda. She seems pretty nice, which is why I’m really not sure about all this.\n\n At my work, we have a tradition where once a new employee successfully completes their probation, we go out for a team lunch. Nothing fancy, but something nice to celebrate. Linda passed her probation, so we went out for lunch.\n\n As we’re eating, we all get to talking, and the topic of ‘the magic of pregnancy/childbirth’ comes up. Everyone was sharing sweet moments from their pregnancy. I enthusiastically joined in but didn’t share any of my own. I think Linda noticed because she specifically turned to me and said:\n\n Linda: “You had twins, didn’t you? That must have been a wonderful experience.”\n\n I smiled and said something along the lines of how I wished my pregnancy and birth had been as positive an experience as theirs had been. To be clear it was not said sarcastically at all.\n\n The truth is I hated every moment of being pregnant. I could write a long list of all the ‘magical’ symptoms I had but I’ll just give you the highlights. Horrific vivid nightmares. Hyperemesis gravidarum (severe morning sickness). Debilitating migraines. A metallic taste in my mouth.\n\n And then the birth…. Honestly I feel like anything that could go wrong (but not be life threatening) did go wrong. Worst of all, due to some of the complications I ended up being kept in hospital for a while, so I missed the first few days with my girls.\n\n It’s safe to say I hated every moment of being pregnant, and every moment of labour. It was not a magical experience by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n I didn’t say any of this to Linda, I just responded as I mentioned. After my reply, Linda started getting short with me. Later, I asked her privately what was going on. She snapped and told me what I said was ‘insensitive’ and ‘undermined’ their experiences and told me I was an a-hole for it.\n\n Since then, she’s sort of cooled off, and is less hostile (or at least less openly hostile), but last week she invited all the girls in the team to a ladies night. Everyone but me. Now, I don’t mind so much, since ladies nights are not really my thing, but the fact that she pointedly excluded me has made things awkward. I feel like I need to do something.\n\n I’m not really in the mood for drama. I have enough of that in my life right now. I don’t need more, so I haven’t confronted her about it yet. And as I said, she is otherwise a really nice person, normally pretty friendly and easy going. So I’m left wondering if I really was an a-hole. Was what I said insensitive? Did it undermine their experience? Before I ask her about it, I could use some perspective because I honestly just don’t know. AITA?",

I am not close with my stepbrother either, we became stepsiblings in hs\n\nMy mom asked us about it about a week ago, we made it clear we didn't really want to and told her we'd let her know.

My mom is an absolute wreck and is now messaging me begging me to make an exception and to just say yes and saying that the alternative is her coming alone, I told her if he's willing to not come to my wedding over a brand new girlfriend not being able to come that's super hurtful.\n\nAre we the assholes here or is it reasonable for us to stand our ground on this?",

      "title": "AITA for taking away my brother's plus one and inviting his girlfriend myself?",
      "body": "I kind of know I am the asshole, but I need to know how bad it was.\n\nMy brother is 29 and has been with Lia for about 2 years. We all like her; she is super nice. I am getting married next April and sent an invite to my brother's apartment. We decided to send invites to households and not individuals. For example, our aunt received an invite for her family and not for each individual.\n\nLast Thursday, we met at my parents' place. It was just the core family because of some tax reasons, lol. While there, I asked my brother about Lia's dietary restrictions. I know that she is a vegetarian for health reasons and that she cannot have certain raw vegetables.\n\nHe said that she wasn't going to come and that he was taking his girl best friend, Amanda, instead. Now, their relationship is weird af. Amanda has always been stringing my brother along, in my opinion. He always denies having feelings for her, but let's be real here.\n\nAmanda would date other guys, blow off my brother, then when things were on the decline with her partners, she would be attached to him again. Her last boyfriend broke up with her right around the time my brother, his then ex-girlfriend, Amanda, and her ex were supposed to travel to Spain. What did my idiot brother do? Go with Amanda alone because Amanda was uncomfortable with his ex-girlfriend. Obviously, he acted blindsided when his girlfriend broke up with him. I didn't even say anything anymore because it's all so weird.\n\nSo, when he said that, I asked if Lia already had other plans. But my brother said that Amanda had asked if she could come because it would be an opportunity to finally see the old gang (we were in the same friend group in high school). I told him that I would have invited Amanda if I wanted her there. Amanda is mean and cold. She always makes disparaging comments about other girls. At every event, around one hour in, she will make some sort of scene that either has her running away crying or sitting mad at a table telling everyone to \"leave her alone\" and then making a cryptic comment about something \"hurting her.\"\n\nI told my brother I was revoking his plus one and Amanda was NOT coming to our wedding. He accused me of being misogynistic and bigoted because I don't understand opposite-sex friendships. Which is BS. My husband has a female childhood friend who is his best woman. I love her too and she has been amazing. AND SHE RESPECTS FUCKING BOUNDARIES. She always includes me and made a huge effort when I started dating my fiancé to integrate me into the friend group.\n\nAnyway, I said my decision was final. He could take it or leave it, but I would be inviting Lia myself because I like her. He screamed at me and told me to keep out of his business. I said to get rid of his weird fucking feelings for Amanda.\nHe is mad at me. My dad said is none of our deal. My mom is furious with my brother. So Aita?\n\n\nEdit: to answer some questions \n\nThe invite was addressed to the \"smith's.\" Funnily enough, Lia had the same last name as us. Granted, we have one of the most common last names.\n\nYes, they live together.\n\n\nThe tax thing is nothing huge. My parents have a small buisness but are really bad at keeping track of all their receipts. So every month we go and help them. We digitalis the receipts and put them in a bookkeeping software for the accountant\n\n\n*Amanda is in the comments. Say hi!*",

      "body": "AITA So to start this story off I’d like to say I am white and have no means of trying to be racist in this moment and I’m genuinely and sincerely sorry if I did offend anyone, but back to the story. A few weeks ago me and my best friend were riding the public transport bus to get to her house as usual, this day the bus was full of people but at one stop this lovely women got on the bus, I had noticed her lace was showing and I thought I’d be a good person and tried to do so as discreet as possible, I waited until she made eye contact with me and then I pointed to my head and did a little pull down motion on the top of my head to indicate I could see her lace, I meant no harm I just wanted to help this women but then my friend starts giggling and I look at her very puzzled but I continue to wait for the lady to look back and when she did I gave her a thumbs up to say she was good. She did and up switching seats a few stops after but I had thought it was for seating purposes. As me and my friend get off the bus I ask my friend “hey why were you giggling so much back there” and she told me that it’s very rude and disrespectful to tell a women of colour to “fix” their hair, I felt horrible in that moment and this moment is playing in my mind all the time wondering was I a asshole to this poor lady. Anyways can someone tell me if I’m in the wrong🥲",

      "title": "WIBTA If I didn’t go to my brother’s wedding over a bridesmaid dress?",
      "body": "I’m currently in medical school and live across the country from my brother/family. I was surprised when his fiancé asked me to be a bridesmaid because I barely know her, but she wants to have all siblings in the wedding. I made it clear that their wedding was during my final exam week, and while I was able to get an accommodation to take my last two exams early I still wouldn’t be able to help much with planning or be present at things like a bachelorette party/bridal shower. She said this was fine, it would mostly just be to have an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen and for pictures.\n\nThere’s a group chat that was created months ago that I would read through every couple of days to get updates on things I needed to do, namely to order a bridesmaid dress. Links were sent with three styles to choose from and we would be updated on colors later. So a couple weeks go by and I ask what color to order, bride says she still thinking about it. Couple more weeks go by and she's still thinking… then a couple more weeks. You get the idea. Now it’s at the point that if I don’t order this dress in a couple of days it won’t be here in time. So I ask on Saturday what color. No response in the group chat to me.\n\nI asked again yesterday (Sunday) what color do I need to order? Then I’m flooded with messages lambasting me for not ordering a dress yet, from her sisters and my sister and her. My sister called me, told me to “get my sh\\*t together” and “order a dress already” because my lack of preparedness is causing the bride intense anxiety because she doesn’t think my dress will be here on time for the wedding now. She texted me this morning, “don’t forget order your dress, love you” with smiling and kissing emojis.\n\nStill, no one has told me what color! I’ve scoured the group chat for a mention of dress colors or an image of a dress but only the maid of honor sent a photo of her dress and I don’t know if she has a special color. There’s thousands of messages so it’s not simple to find anything. Everyone else can meet in person so I assume the decision on color was relayed in person. I can’t tell if I’m being purposefully excluded?\n\nAbout an hour ago my brother called me pleading with me to work things out with the bride because she’s panicking about me. I tried to explain this to him and he told me he doesn’t care, its a petty ladies issue, and since I’m not there for anything else this is the least I can do because the bride thinks I don’t like her because I wouldn’t come to anything. He’s taking her side. They know I’m in medical school, I have literally no say in my schedule. And I’m on the other side of the country, 5.5 hours by plane.\n\nI’m fed up with them and contemplating telling my instructors the wedding was moved and I will take my exams at the regular time. I’d have more time to study that way anyway. I haven’t told anyone in my family I’m considering this. WIBTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I called my mother and asked her what color the bridesmaid dresses are, she said lavender. The only color option on the website that I would call lavender are named pearly lilac, periwinkle, and orchid purple. I texted the maid of honor (bride’s sister) to ask what dress color and got a multi-paragraph long lecture about not having ordered my dress yet. Basically, they are trying so hard to accommodate me being across the country by including me in the group chat. She said she didn’t remember the shade name but its a “dusty purple” then sent a blurry picture of a wrinkled order confirmation, the shade name was “mulberry.” On the dress website that is a darker wine/purple color. I told her this and she said to order the lighter dusty purple color.\n\nI sent her a screen shot with the list of shade names and asked, “which of these?” She said she didn’t know because everyone ordered their dress so long ago and asked for pictures of the dresses in different shades from the website. So I sent screenshots of all the light purple colors. No response for a while so I called her on the phone, which she was upset about because its past 10pm over there now. Her response was “look, I don’t care what your problem is with me and my sister but if you want to stay in good standing with this family you need to get your ducks lined up girly.”\n\nI ignored the lecture/comments and asked: “what color?”\n\nHer response? “Light purple”\n\nMe: “of the three I sent, which one is it?”\n\nHer: “I don’t remember, I’ll have to ask one of the other bridesmaids for her receipt, I’ll get back to you”\n\nI want to bash my head into a wall!\n\nI called my second brother, the one not getting married. He said they’re pulling similar things with him and he feels like he was deliberately given the wrong dates for the bachelor party by the best man (bride’s brother) so that he would miss it. He inadvertently learned about the changed date the morning of and when he asked the best man he told him it must have slipped his mind to tell him. Then joked that he wouldn’t have missed much since he probably won’t enjoy any of the “festivities” anyway. They’ve been making homophobic jokes and comments to him that he’s been ignoring but he thinks they’re trying to get him to back out of the wedding. So if we both back out then there will be an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen again. Only speculation on our parts of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick update: I was seriously considering pulling out, but the collective rage here and my fading motivation to study has me thinking… by this point, with how this post took off, I wouldn’t be surprised if they find it at some point so I don’t want to reveal my cards just yet. Thank you to the comments that gave me the idea. I guess I’ll be making an update mid June if it all goes to plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL UPDATE\n\nThanks to some responses, I called the bridal salon and asked what colors were ordered. Four dresses in the color “flint” one in “mulberry.” The MOH was setting me up to believe “mulberry” was the color of ALL the dresses. So, I ordered one in mulberry and one in flint. I only let the MOH know I purchased a \"mulberry\" dress.\n\nI caught a red eye to be there for the rehearsal. They had a room to get ready in the morning and wanted all the dresses stored there. I show up with the mulberry dress. The bride begins crying because it’s “too late to fix it!” She asks if I would be upset if asked to drop out because mulberry is for the MOH.\n\nI pretended like I had made such a big mistake! I said, “I know a girl that works at the salon. Let me call her and see if there’s anyway to make it right, and if not I’ll step down because I want you to have the perfect day.” I show back up the next morning to start getting ready with the correct dress in tow. “My friend looked in the back for me and they JUST had this returned yesterday, what are the odds! Exact style, color and my size, it’s a sign!”\n\nSilence. Then an awkward, “that’s amazing.”\n\nNow I’ll be honest, I thought the revenge would be that they had to have me and younger brother in the wedding and photos. I couldn’t have planned the next part. They had to explain to the makeup artist there was an additional bridesmaid meaning they planned from the beginning that I wouldn't be in this wedding.\n\nThe ceremony went fine. We took photos after.\n\nThen, there were no place settings for me and little bro with the wedding party at the reception since banked on one less bridesmaid and one less groomsman being present. The table was almost not long enough, two chairs had to be thrown on the ends. We didn’t get food Initially because we were actually in the seating plan at other tables so our plates were brought to those place settings. I can tell my brother (groom) seems ticked off at the staff for seemingly not having things set up properly but the bride and best man diverted his attention.\n\nBefore he (groom) left he found me and said he asked the MOH why the setting were wrong and he was told I asked to be dropped from the wedding party weeks ago then showed up and demanded to be in the wedding.\n\nI said I didn't ask to be dropped and showed him my phone where she gave me a thumbs up on the dress. He noticed the screenshot was not the dress I was currently wearing so I said I had to last minute switch it out after confusion on the color. He seemed satisfied with that.\n\nThey left on their honeymoon, and my brother returned several days early… alone. So, you can guess how that went.",

      "body": "**UPDATE: i haven't logged into this account in a while but i tried to update and it got removed so i will just copy and paste it into here**\n\n**I decided to ask my daughter how she feels about all of this and she said that she likes going to daycare and that all of her friends are there. I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**\n\nA while ago my daughter\\[8f\\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont have\n\nEDIT: we live in the deep south",

      "title": "AITA for bringing a generic product vs the name brand I was asked to bring?",
      "body": "This seems so silly to me but it became such a big deal, I have to ask.\n\nLast weekend, my girlfriend’s family hosted a BBQ. I was always raised to never show up anywhere empty-handed, so I asked my girlfriend’s mom what I could bring. She asked that I grab the Cool Whip for a dessert she was making.. Easy enough. I figured it won’t be hard to find, so, I decide to wait until morning of to grab it on my way there.\n\nWell, I get to the store about 20 minutes before the BBQ starts and they’re somehow out of the name brand. They did, however, have the store brand’s “whipped topping”. As I didn’t have time to go to another grocery store, I just bought the generic brand and headed off.\nUpon arrival, I hand the bag to my girlfriend’s mom. She opens it, looks inside and gets a weird look on her face. She asks where the Cool Whip is. I say the store was out, but this is pretty much the same thing, right? She looks a little irritated with me but just tells me to make myself at home. As I’m putting my stuff down, I hear her asking her husband to r un to the store and grab the Cool Whip. I can’t hear the entire conversation, but he must have asked didn’t I bring it because I then hear her say “I asked for one thing and he couldn’t even deliver”. \n\nNothing else was said directly to me, but there were a few passive-aggressive remarks throughout the BBQ. Such as when her husband arrived, name brand in hand, calling him her “hero”. When the dessert was served, she again made a comment about how it’s made with “real Cool Whip”. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I took it on the chin.\n\nWhen talking to my girlfriend about it later, she said that her mom was overdramatic but I should’ve called her to ask if generic was okay. Or I could’ve gone to a different store. I asked if there was really a difference and she said she doesn’t know, but it was what I was asked to bring, so I should’ve communicated better.\nAgain, this all sound so stupid but…am I the asshole?\n",

      "title": "AITA for telling my child's step-mother to grow up and stop asking a teenager for support?",
      "body": "I (39F) have two children, Kimmy, (14F) and (9M) and share custody with their father, Dave. Kimmy is starting high school soon and her school sent a list of their extracurriculars. I want my children to be academically inclined and join clubs to meet people. I told Kimmy to pick some clubs, and as of right now she picked out 10 (which we are definitely going to shorten down).\n\nKimmy sent a list of clubs to her father so he could help her. He didn't respond and instead, I got a call from Dave's wife, Amy, a little later. Amy asked me if Kimmy was really going to join all of those clubs, and I said not all but probably some of them.\n\nAmy followed by asking if Kimmy could only join one of the clubs on her list, which confused me. I asked why. Amy explained that she has to go to work soon, and she really needs someone to take care of her kids. She was hoping that Kimmy would be able to go to their house straight after school and take care of them.\n\nAmy has 3 kids under 13, and recently had a baby with Dave. Kimmy has ADHD which makes it hard for her to care for her own needs. I already feel extremely uncomfortable leaving her with 4 kids that young unattended. Amy didn't even mention transportation and how Kimmy would get there. I told her no.\n\nThis upset Amy. She told me that Kimmy is a part of her family too, and as a family they all need to chip in and according to her, Kimmy should chip in by babysitting. She ranted on, giving me a sob story as to how she was struggling already with Dave working, how hard it was to be mom to 4 kids who depend on her so much, and how expensive childcare was nowadays.\n\nI told her no, and why I was uncomfortable, to which she just reiterated her story (this happened twice). By this time, I said no 3 times and she was still asking. I thought it was clear that no meant no, not no and ask again later. I interrupted her and told her no is my final answer and she's honestly pathetic to ask a 14-year-old for support and it sounds she needs to grow up instead of relying on children to pick up her slack.\n\nAs you would expect, Amy and Dave are upset at me, which I don't really mind. My only issue is that when I told my sister, she thought I was being cruel which is making me rethink things. AITA?\n\nEdit: A common question I'm being asked is what custody looks like. My kids go to their father's one week every month and stay with me for the rest. But there are times where they stay at their father's longer than expected (with my permission). For instance, the kids stayed a couple weeks at their father for the summer. Sometimes they stay an extra few days, but the custody is officially me 3/4 and him 1/4, with me being their primary caregiver.\n\nEdit2: A lot of you guys are asking about Amy's kids. The oldest is around my son's age albeit a bit older, and I literally have no idea if their father is helping them or if they have the same father because it's none of my business and those are not at all my kids.\n\nEdit3: While I'm very glad a lot you fellow millennials liked The Babysitter Club, can you please stop using it as a reference? I've read some ridiculous comments on this post, but using fictional 12-year-olds who acted like teenagers as a reason for my child to babysit are one of the most ridiculous ones I've seen. That's like if I used Aladdin to prove why my kids should get a genie.\n\nEdit4: Additionally, I don't think struggling moms should be bashed, but they should be treated like humans and need to know when boundaries were crossed. Dave and I have been co-parenting for a while, so there was a time when I was in Amy's shoes and wondering what I would do with my kiddos. A thought that did not cross my mind was asking a minor to unwillingly drop all of their interests. There's a difference between setting boundaries and knowing my child can't take on a responsibility and simply wanting to put a struggling mother down just because it was another Tuesday.\n\nEdit5: My kids have also been talked to this about, and we're setting firm boundaries with step-mom and dad.",

I knew exactly what he wanted and shared it with her. However, it was too expensive for her and she asked if there was something cheaper she could get. Unfortunately, I couldn't think of anything cause if it was in her budget and he wanted it, he probably would have purchased it for himself already. I offered to split the cost with her and she accepted. It was more than I was planning to spend, but he's a good friend and I knew it was exactly what he wanted so I splurged a bit. \n\nWhen his birthday rolled around, it turned out his girlfriend didn't give me any credit for the gift. She did not put my name anywhere on the bag or card. Even when he asked how she knew she kinda just brushed it off with a joke \"I know you better than you know yourself\". I was annoyed and clarified to everyone how she actually got the gift - that I picked it out and paid for half of it. His girlfriend got quiet and didn't say much. Some people told me afterwards I'm an asshole for putting her on the spot. I don't really feel like she was entitled to discretion when she was well aware of my contribution. I would have been fine with her taking all credit if I didn't pay for half of it, but I didn't get my friend anything else because of what I spent on her gift for him. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\nTL;DR - helped my friends girlfriend pick a bday present for him, paid for half of it, and girlfriend didn't give me credit.

This is getting so draining feeling like im living a double life. Do I tell them?\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not allowing my niece to use \"promised\" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? My family is derisively calling me \"Scott's Tots\" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.",
      "body": "Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the \"best unwatchable episode of TV ever\" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. \n\nSo how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the \"removed\" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. \n\nMy cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. \n\nI basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  \n\nThat's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of \"Scott's Tots\" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. \n\nNo amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). \n\nThere is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. \n\nI have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?\n\nEdit: just for my own notes since I’m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.\n\nCousin A (nieces mom), 38: paid.\n\nCousin/sister  J, 32: paid.\n\nMe: paid \n\nCousin B, 25: not paid.\n\nCousin J2, 20: in school.\n\nNiece K, 18: not paid (subject of post).\n\nA, B and K are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day.",

      "body": "This isn’t necessarily my proudest moment but I am tired of being the outcast.\n\nMy (32f) husband “Pete” (34m) comes from a family where the women are all bakers. I am a baker myself and I used to sell out of my house under my states cottage laws but stopped because I like it just being a hobby.\n\nHis SIL “Kay” (39) is the one who is “known” for her cupcakes and cake pops.  When I first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing I learned.  Everyone talked about everything she made.  Even when Pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that Kay sells hers and they’re popular so they must be better.  Whenever I bring treats, they are often left untouched because “they are not Kay’s”.  Yes, I’ve been told that.  They ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  \n\nTo be clear, Kay is mainly a baker whereas I bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  Kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and Pete’s family agrees.\n\nWe had a BBQ Monday for Memorial Day and everyone made their treats.  Kay decided to bring cake pops. She posted them on her Instagram the night before.  So, and I know this immature, I made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. \n\nWe got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  I said they’re in car and I’ll get them in a minute.  So I waited for everyone to be outside then I brought mine in and put them next to Kay’s.\n\nAfter we eat, I notice the family eating my cake pops and not Kay’s.  She didn’t notice at first and then asked if they weren’t feeling cake pops.  They said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  MIL even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.\n\nKay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  That’s when I said, “Oh, I brought those.  Glad you enjoyed them.”\n\nHer husband said he hadn’t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said “yeah, they were okay.”  Kay didn’t say anything the rest of the night.\n\nPete thought it was funny (he didn’t know what I did until the reveal) but his brother (Kay’s husband) said yesterday that what I did was mean and I’m just mad that Kay is a better baker.  But Pete said it’s ridiculous the family, including Kay, puts down my baking when they won’t even try it all because I’m not Kay. AITA?\n\nETA:  We aren’t the only two who bring desserts, just the ones who tend to bake cake more than others.  Everyone else’s desserts get eaten to some degree except mine.\n\nEdit 2:  If it’s not clear, “everyone” includes Kay.  She has often tried to “teach” me techniques that I either already knew or were completely wrong.  So she wasn’t like an innocent that got caught in the line of fire or something.",

      "body": "\nI’m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.  \n\nI (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M’s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we’re held to strict standards.  \n\nMy husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. \n\nThis is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can’t be detailed). However, it’s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. \n\nMy company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn’t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.\n\nIt’d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don’t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. \n\nI asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we’d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. \n\nHe was extremely angry, and said I was “selfish and only cared about money.” I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn’t possible. \n\nHe continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn’t being a supportive wife. \n\nI feel so betrayed, and I’ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it’s better coming from my email than from a background check. \n\nI told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. \n\nI feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It’s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",

      "body": "I have waited tables for the last three years.\n\nDuring my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",

      "body": "\n\nFor context_ I'm a sahm with 2 kids (3yrs old & 6months old) My husband is an ambulance driver, he works odd hours and comes home unexpectedly, he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.\n\nAfter struggling with this for long, my mom suggested that I start pre-making meals so that dinner or lunch can be ready when he's home, all he's gotta do is just reheat it. I immediately got to it and went grocery shopping and spent an entire 2 days making meals and storing them in the fridge. His response to this idea is \"whatever\". I was sort of relieved cause now I could sleep properly, the kids care won't get interrupted etc.\n\n\nWell, at 11pm last night, he comes home while I'm sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake up to him shouting for me from the livingroom. I rush out and ask what was happening and he tells me he's hungry and wants dinner. I tell him it's in the fridge and just needs to be reheated and he didn't have to wake me up for it. He tells me I need to go reheat it for him. I say no, not happening and he needs to reheat his own dinner. He starts laughing sarcastically which got me mad. He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be \"expected\" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself, when I'm here and I can do it. I start arguing with him after he complains I'm not doing enough and refuse to reheat it then I go back inside the bedroom and shut the door.\n\nHe comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, I tell him he's being unreasonable to expect me to reheat his dinner when he could do it himself. He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out. This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.",

      "body": "I (50F) and my husband (48M) have a daughter, Danica (21F), who has been extremely independent her whole life. Danica began working when she was 15, and now she works part-time for a large corporation while pursuing her studies. We are extremely proud of her and how hard she has worked. We generally allow her to manage her own finances, and she insists on contributing monthly to family expenses with the money she earns. Danica occasionally likes to make pricier purchases, which I do not have any concern over, as I think they are sensible financial choices. Like last year, she decided to purchase the newest MacBook as her old laptop was on its last leg, and she wanted something reliable and long-lasting or when she bought a Marc Jacobs bag for work and university. \n\nWe recently went on a family trip with my brother and his family, who have two kids of their own, Tammy (20F) and Nick (23M). His kids and Danica aren't exactly close, but they get along fine for the most part.  I know that Tammy and Nick do not have any source of income besides my brother and have not worked a day in their life. During the trip, Danica would occasionally pay for the 3 of them for small things like drinks or food. When we were shopping, Danica bought a  few items for herself and picked up gifts she wanted to bring back to her friends. During dinner that night, my sister-in-law (brother's wife) told my husband and me that we were spoiling Danica too much with her purchases. We explained that Danica earned her own money, and every cent came from her job. Sister-in-law then proceeded to point and tell Danica that if that was the case, she shouldn't be flaunting her purchases and items in front of her cousins, who don't have a 'cushy little office job' and parents who 'spoiled her into the person she is'. Danica apologised politely, saying that she didn't mean to flaunt her things, but I could tell that she was upset and embarrassed. My husband stood up and shot back, saying that Danica shouldn't have to apologise for her own hard work. I also pointed out that Danica has been financially independent since she was 15 and that we've always done our best not to spoil her. Sister in Law then proceeded to tell us that we weren't teaching her how to manage her finances correctly and that all this money had turned her into a little 'brat'. Danica excused herself to the bathroom and texted that she had gone back to the hotel. We had a tense back and forth for the rest of the dinner, and we came back to finding Danica crying in her hotel room. I call my brother, hoping that he is able to talk to his wife, but he explained that for the past few days, Tammy had been crying to her parents about not having what Danica had. She had been whining to her mum that she wanted the newest MacBook, as well, but she refused to get it for her.\n\n  \nMyself, Danica and my Husband have been getting calls from the rest of the family, some calling us A-holes and some who were willing to hear us out and understand where we were coming from. So AITA?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n",

He gets drunk and doesn't feed or water or really even pay attention to the cat, we've consistently had to buy cat food because he blows all of his money on his drinks rather than food (including food for himself), dude barely even takes care of himself.\n\nNow, circling back to the problem. We very quickly had to put in place that he is to not drink while he's on the property and he's not allowed to smoke in the house (the first usually leads to the second), and it wasn't just because he was drinking, it's becausehe can't control himself when he is. Anyways, we had this chat repetitively until I got to the point where it was one more sip on this property and you're done, kicked out, gone. And that night was tonight.\n\nSo here we are, we were his last bridge and it's been burnt. So now he's going to be on the streets, the cat is a flight risk as it runs away any time it escapes out the door, he obviously doesn't want to do what it takes to feed it or keep himself sheltered, I just feel in his current condition he's in no shape to be responsible for any animal.\n\nA bit more context, he's 30. We've offered help, we got him lined up with a job, we've tried being and pointing him in the direction of support systems, we have done everything we can, and he thinks it's all a game, super disrespectful.\n\nTLDR: cousin is an alcoholic that doesn't take care of his cat and just got kicked out of the last place he had to stay.

      "body": "I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \\~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \\~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.\n\nWe called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.\n\nI told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\\*\n\nHoly fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.",

      "body": "---UPDATE  AT BOTTOM---\n\nI'll try to keep it short.\n\nMy wife and I have three boys, 17, 16, and 14. May the lord have mercy on my soul. Actually they are good guys.\n\nI was at Target with my youngest, Tanner. We split for a while and he shows back up asking if he could buy something with his own money. It was a beard trimmer. I laughed and told him he didn't need that yet. He explained nope, not for his face, he wanted it for downstairs.  His older brothers both manscape and he wanted to as well. But they wouldn't loan their trimmers.\n\nI told him sure, I'd even buy it for him.\n\nGot home and wife was not impressed. She didn't want him to have it. One excuse after the other. ***He's not old enough.*** Sure he is. ***He didn't need it yet.*** Ok true he's not exactly taming a jungle, more like a small hedge, but if he wants to neaten things up that's fine by me. ***I don't want more hair all over their bathroom.*** Non-issue. The boys keep their bathroom clean. While me, Tanner, and the oldest Liam are pretty smooth, middle boy Lucas somehow got the gorilla gene (he was Sasquatch at 14). If he's not causing a problem, no one will.\n\nI told him he could keep the trimmer but wife seems pursed. I did remind him to keep the bathroom free of little hairs... get brothers to help/advise if needed, or me... and don't make the mistake of going all Kojak below the belt, Liam made that mistake a couple of years ago. With much itching.\n\nSo AITA for disregarding my wife's opinion?\n\n  \nUPDATE --\n\nThanks everyone. I'm overwhelmed by all the comments, I only expected a few views/responses.  I appreciate all who commented. I read them all even if I could not reply back to each.'\n\nAll's good here. Last night I talked with my wife, as many theorized she is just wistful that the last baby bird is growing up (although all are still in the nest). She knows none of them will be little boys forever but she was (and is) such a good \"boy mom\" that she's missing those times already... and had a not-so-great reaction. That's ALL there is to it. Thankfully.\n\nAs for Tanner, I went up to the oldest's room where all three were hanging out (you never know where the posse of hooligans will be). Tanner said \"Check it out!\" stood up and dropped his shorts in a flash.. and yep, the hedge clippers had been at work. I told him great job, looks good. He said \"Liam had to do most of it.\" Liam shrugged.  I'm very blessed that they all get along so well and that the older two are excellent big brothers (MOST of the time).\n\nTo a couple of ppl who DM'ed me, no none of us are nudists or anything like that LOL but they are definitely those never-wear-shirts guys, and when getting ready to go out you never know which one or ONES will be in the shower. The guys are just self assured (maybe too much), and not a shy bone in their bodies. Years ago TWICE my oldest (who had long hair then) went as Tarzan for Halloween. And my middle boy once went to a neighborhood costume contest as Michael Phelps in nothing but a Speedo and eight gold medals around his neck (and this was years after Phelps won). \n\nThey keep me young and make me very tired at the same time.\n\nThanks everyone!",

      "body": "I’m from France originally, and I moved to the states almost 2 years ago. Now for some reason, the food here makes me sick. Not in an “Ew, that’s gross.” Kind of way. But actually physically sick. My body seems to struggle to digest it. Whether it’s take out or fancy restaurant food. Either I can’t go to the bathroom for days, or I’m violently vomiting. I tried dealing with it for months and months, but I started losing weight very quickly because I couldn’t eat. I ended up developing a serious aversion to food, and my family recommended I go and speak to a specialist.\n\nI had never had a problem back home, and I was terrified I was seriously ill. So I went to multiple doctors where I was poked and prodded and I had multiple tests done. They have all said nothing is wrong with me physically.\n\nI spoke to a dietitian and he explained that my body is probably not used to the amount of salt and preservatives that is found in the food in the states. (Please don’t think I’m bashing the US! I love it here and it’s a great country.) My dietician recommended fresh and organic produce to see how my body coped, and to my delight, I improved.\n\nI stopped vomiting and I was able to start slowly putting weight back on. I started making meals from scratch and meal prepping to save time throughout the week. My dad is actually a chef back home, so he was more than happy to send me some recipes to keep my diet interesting. I made a delicious vegetarian lasagna from scratch, and put it in the oven to cook. My boyfriend (American) came home after work and asked what was for dinner. I said I was making a veggie lasagna. He rolled his eyes and said he was sick of “that organic crap” and wanted a cheeseburger.\n\nThe comment hurt. I made a real effort at meal times to keep it varied so we’re not always eating the same thing. I said I couldn’t make one because I didn’t even have any burger buns. He said it was unfair to “make” him eat my diet. I had never realized he was opposed to it. He benefited from home cooked meals and I had seen that his clothes were fitting him better. He had more energy and he didn’t sleep so much on the weekends. I apologized and said I didn’t mean to make him feel forced.\n\nAITA for forcing my diet on him?",

We had discussed this before she even got the phone, then had some issues last year. As a last resort, I told her if that happened again, the phone would become mine and she’d get an old flip phone that was my husband’s  with no internet until she could prove trust. \n\nThe school policies had changed this term from a phone would be confiscated until a parent could come get it to a phone would be kept for 2 weeks as a first offense, 3 for second, so on and so forth. I wasn’t okay with this as I don’t trust the school to not lose it (i know they’ve lost/broken other students’ phones) plus I don’t want them having access to my daughter’s private info. I went to the school and requested it back, saying I wouldn’t give it to my daughter but I paid for it. Secretary gave me the spiel and I didn’t blame her but asked to speak with the vice principal. He comes out and repeats them. I said okay but I’m the parent, I paid for it and I never signed anything giving you permission to hold it. They were refusing so I said I’d sit in the office until it was given back. I did so and waited for close to 2 hours. Finally the principal came out and said I needed to leave. I said if I left, I’d be back with a police escort. At that point, the phone was returned to me.\n\n\nMy husband says I “Karen’d” my way out of it. To me, it’s not their property to take. AITA?",

      "body": "I'm moving to another city for work. Since I'm an adult and not a college kid I hired movers. \n\nMy parents insisted on coming down to help me pack up. I live in their basement suite. It was cheap and they let me have my privacy. They brought my brother and my nephew. The four of them were as helpful as a bag of used horse condoms. Especially my nephew. \n\nMy parents decided to keep him busy by giving him one of my Lego sets to play with. I collect them. What I usually do is buy two of the same one. I build one, put it up for display and leave the other one in the box to trade or sell. \n\nHe took it upstairs to stay out of the way then he took it home. All I noticed is that he was out from under foot. \n\nThe next day I saw the box on the garbage. I didn't assume. I knew the answer already but I didn't assume. I went upstairs to talk to them. I asked where the Lego box came from. They said they gave it to Travis to keep him busy. I told them that they needed to replace it. They said I was being childish for caring so much about a toy. I said they could replace it or I would file an insurance claim and that would probably require a police report. \n\nMy dad got angry. He pulled out $70 and told me I was an asshole for making a fuss over a toy. I asked him if that was a down payment? He said that is what he spent on the last Lego gift he got me for Christmas and that is what those helmets cost. \n\nI showed him the box. I told him to keep his money. He just had to give me a sealed box like the one he stole. \n\nHe said he didn't steal anything. He took the box and went to the Lego store nearby. \n\nWhen he came back he was apologetic. He said he would get it back from my nephew. I said I wanted a sealed box with the Tie Fighter helmet. I even went on eBay to help him find one cheaper than he had found by himself at the collectibles store the guy at the Lego store sent him to. With shipping it would only be $300. He ordered it. He isn't happy about it. \n\nMy mom is upset that I'm expecting that much money for a toy. My dad is upset that I didn't explain before he went and made a fool of himself at the store. I'm upset that they stole from me. \n\nAITA?",

      "body": "Obligatory please excuse any formatting issues, I’m on mobile!\n\nAnyway, I (35f) have been dating my boyfriend (40m) for almost 2y. We do not live together, but we see each other frequently, and every other weekend when he doesn’t have his daughter, he normally stays here multiple days, so it’s like his “home away from home”. I do not stay at his house often because I am a single mom of a 14 year old, and I’m not comfortable leaving her alone overnight. \n\nI have been short on money lately because all of my bills have gone up at the same time, so we’ve mostly been cooking at my house. Either I’ll grab a few things from the store and cook, he’ll bring food over he makes, or he brings over ingredients and I cook them. Once in a while we take turns treating for something cheap like pizza or other fast food, but for the most part we’ve been cooking. \n\nA few weekends ago, I had literally zero dollars to grocery shop, so he brought over a bunch of stuff to last the weekend, which included frozen cheese ravioli and a bag of meatballs. After figuring out his bills, he discovered that he had some extra money to treat to a dinner out, so the ravioli ended up not being cooked. He said that he wanted to bring it home so he could cook it for himself and his daughter. Of course I said it was ok, he bought the food. Well, that was like three weeks ago. He’s been over several times since, and he never grabbed the food when he left, even after me reminding him several times. \n\nFast forward to today, I am in a spot where I’m broke until next payday and can’t go to the store until then. My daughter has a friend over, and I needed to cook them something for dinner. I looked in the freezer and saw the ravioli and meatballs were still there. I opted to cook them because it was an easy meal that I know the girls will eat. My boyfriend asked what I had for dinner, and I told him the ravioli, and he asked “my ravioli?!” And I said “yes”, and he got upset and told me “you could have asked me if it was ok and I would have said yes” “I wanted to bring that home to cook” etc. I thought he was joking at first, but he wasn’t. I didn’t think it was a big deal since it had been sitting in my freezer for three weeks, but with how upset he got, I’m starting to think I should have asked. So AITA? \n\n\nETA: To everyone commenting about my finances, my daughter is well taken care of. She doesn’t go hungry. She has snacks and food in my house that are just hers. This meal was literally to feed three people. I’ll never understand why everyone hates poor people lol. ",

      "body": "Hi so I work at a McDonald's inside of a Walmart, earlier I was working and on my break I went to browse around Walmart, I had a can of Red bull that I had purchased earlier that day. For reference the small cans cost 3-4$ in Canada. So while I was browsing around, I went to the washroom in Walmart and put my drink on top of an old hand dryer that was out of order while I was using the washroom. When I came out of the stall there was a girl cleaning and I noticed my red bull was gone. I asked her \"did you just throw out my red bull?\" She said \"uhh yes\", I replied \"It was still full\" (I had only taken a few sips) and she replies \"Kinda\". And then says sorry in the most non apologetic tone ever, to which I scoffed. This has been pissing me off all day. Even though It's just a drink I was really excited to drink it during my shift and that's like 3$ down the drain. I can afford it but still feel like that's beside the point. I feel like the girl definitely could have been more apologetic. Not to mention there were several people in the washroom so I feel like It's common courtesy to ask if it belongs to anyone, especially since it was obviously full and still cold. I would go as far as to say that if I were in her shoes I would offer to replace it. Am I overreacting? ",

      "body": "There are these people we’ve known since childhood. We’ll call the guy John, and my sister is Stacy. John has two sisters that live with him. Me and Stacy hadn’t really hung out with them—we just knew them. One day, John and Stacy hung out, and she kept bugging me to come too, saying they were fun.\n\nFast forward four days—we’ve been hanging out every day and doing new stuff. Today, we were at their house playing games, watching movies, etc. Around 12 PM, they said they were going to the corner store for drinks. They came back, dropped off snacks, and left again saying they were getting wings. About 15–20 minutes later, John came back alone and immediately washed his hands and mouth—which stood out because he’s never done that.\n\nOne of his sisters asked where the wings were and if me and Stacy were leaving since Stacy stayed in the car. He said, “Yeah, she’s waiting for me,” and claimed both wing places they went to were closed. I Googled them—they weren’t. That, plus him washing up, made me suspicious.\n\nI went to my car and it smelled like sex, but also hot chips, so the scent was mixed. Still, I had a gut feeling. I asked my sister where they went, and she said “to get wings.” I chuckled but didn’t say anything else.\n\nWhile driving home, I kept thinking about it. Her lipstick was gone, her hair slightly messed up—nothing major, but it looked perfect before. That added to the list. I asked if they did something in my car. She denied it over and over, which I expected.\n\nWhen we got home and she got out, there was a little piece of a condom wrapper on the seat. I said, “Wow… a condom wrapper,” and she just laughed. That confirmed it. I started to feel a type of way because it all happened in my car—and it could’ve been avoided if she just brought hers.\n\nI told her it was disrespectful and nasty, especially because I love my car and try my best to keep it clean. Even I wouldn’t do that in it. They lied about where they went, lied about the wings (which we were excited about 😭), had sex in my car, and kept lying. I didn’t expect her to be fully honest—because I know it’s awkward—but doing that in my car, knowing how much I care about it, was unnecessary and gross.\n\nNow I don’t really want to hang out with them anymore. I’ve lost respect for John. He always came off respectful and big on boundaries, but I guess that didn’t apply to me. I don’t know if I’m reacting off emotion or finally seeing things for what they are—but I just don’t want to be around them anymore.\n",

      "body": "\nI (27F) have been best friends with “Claire” (28F) since high school. When she asked me to be her Maid of Honor, I was thrilled and went all out to make her wedding special. I paid for the bridal shower, bachelorette party (a weekend trip), decorations, and other expenses, spending several thousand dollars. While it was a lot of money for my husband and me, I wanted to make her big day perfect because she’s like family to me.\n\nTwo months ago, I shared that I’m 4 months pregnant. Claire congratulated me but started acting distant afterward. She excluded me from conversations about the wedding and made passive comments about how “hard it is to coordinate” when people are “distracted.” I brushed it off, thinking it was wedding stress.\n\nA few days ago, she sat me down and told me she didn’t want me in the wedding anymore. Her reason? I’m “getting too fat,” and she doesn’t want me in the pictures. She said she has a specific “vision” for her wedding, and I no longer fit it. I was devastated. I asked if this was about my pregnancy, but she insisted it wasn’t personal. She said she was replacing me as MOH with another friend who fit her “aesthetic.”\n\nI told her if I wasn’t in the wedding, I wouldn’t attend at all. I also handed her the receipts for everything I’d paid for and told her she or her fiancé needed to reimburse me since I’d only spent that money as her MOH. Claire flipped out, calling me selfish and accusing me of trying to ruin her wedding. She said it was “tacky” to ask for the money back and that expenses like these were “my responsibility as MOH.” I reminded her that she removed me from that role, so those expenses were no longer mine.\n\nSince then, Claire, her fiancé, and even her family have been spamming me with calls and texts. They’re accusing me of being petty and overreacting because of “pregnancy hormones.” They’re also saying I should’ve just let it go and written off the money because weddings are stressful, and Claire didn’t mean to hurt me.\n\nMy husband has been incredibly supportive and says I did the right thing. He’s furious at how Claire treated me and agrees that I shouldn’t be out thousands of dollars for a wedding I’m not part of.\n\nI feel heartbroken and humiliated by someone I thought was my best friend. Still, the constant backlash has made me second-guess myself. AITA for standing up for myself and asking for reimbursement? Should I have just quietly stepped aside?",

She convinced me that if I didn’t stop seeing women that our parents would take custody of my child. I know that sounds crazy but my religious family has always judged and looked down on me. So I believed her and went back to dating men. I had another child and after that I finally found the courage to date women again. I had a serious girlfriend and I told my sister about it. Aside from some mildly judgey comments she actually supported the relationship. Until I told her I was planning on coming out to mom and dad. She was adamantly against it. To the point that I left her house and cried all the way to my girlfriend’s house. Long story short but I don’t spend much time around my family now. Im basically low contact with all of them. I’m so strong away from them but so weak around them. Recently my sister planned an outing with me, her and mom. This is always tense for me but it went ok. Then my sister is telling me she’d love to go see a drag show, because she’s not homophobic, right? So the pick me came out in me and I told her I’d take her to pride. She also suggested our 82yr mom joins us. I know if I went with them my mom would say a bunch of Karen comments and I don’t care how open my sister appears to the world, I know how she is and I can’t shake the things she said before. So should I risk being with problem people at a place I feel safe, or should I just “forget” to tell her. \n\nAlso, before it comes up, if I had the ability to confront my family I would have done it a long time ago. I wish I could, but I just can’t. ",

      "body": "For reference I am 23F and my sister is 30F and we both live with our parents. My mom asked me to share my location with her a while back and I declined saying that it's just my boundary and I don't want to. We argued for a bit and then dropped the topic. My sister was sharing her location with my mom but stopped sharing it with her last week and my mom exploded and got so mad. She told us that we don't need to drive her to work anymore and that we basically don't have to do anything for her. We moved past that and still drove her and picked her up, thinking that we moved on. Today my sister asked if she can take the car just to run an errand. My mom said if she turns on her location then she can use it. My sister nicely said, \"it's okay then, I can walk there.\" This comment made my mom so mad and she said she can't believe that my sister would rather walk instead of sharing her location. So clearly my mom just wants the location just to be in control rather than using it for safety like she says. Later, I came down and talked to my mom and my sister was there. I was telling her that I don't understand why she has to take something away from us (not using the car) just because we're not comfortable sharing it with her. By the way, I barely ever use the car, I don't need it, but the principle of it all just bothered me. She threw it back in my face that I share my location with my friends and that she has the right to take something away from us because we are not being good daughters. This hurt because my sister and I try our best with making her happy, helping her around the house, etc. She told my sister and I that her relationship with us has changed after our reluctance sharing our location with her. Honestly, I'm so appalled at the way she is acting. She has never asked me to share my location when I was teenager and now it's a whole big thing. We have such a good relationship but I feel like I saw a different side of her. There's no middle ground that we can agree on. So AITA and should just turn it on for her? ",

      "body": "Hi, I've a random roommate who moved in about 10 months ago, and she's very nice. From the start we got along very well, just great to watch TV and hang in the house (she's a lot more homebody than I am). When she moved in, she first asked if there were any house rules - me previously living with a close friend where everything was shared, I said no - the only rule was that please mind and take care of my kitchen knife (which I spent over $300 for).\n\nFast forward a few months, she hasn't really contributed any new things to the kitchen or shared living space - and she often says that she's tight or watchful with money (which is fine - but I'd love if she put in some effort to help, or stoop / look on Marketplace. She's just very passive). At the same time, I've had to remind her to dry my kitchen knife after using since it'll get damaged which she forgot a few times, or to please clean the drain of hair after showering, or to help clean. She only does these things when I ask or prompt her, otherwise she just leaves it. She also knocked over one of my plant pots once, and just left all the soil on the floor for days - until I texted her asking if she was going to clean it.\n\nFrom a couple months ago I got to the point that I didn't feel comfortable with her using my knife anymore, and also her new boyfriend and her would start to use all my kitchen things for cooking a lot more often. I don't really mind but one time she saw I got a new kitchen oven mitt, and said to her boyfriend, \"Look! We got an oven mitt!\" Which I got frustrated at. I believe at least in that scenario it would be polite to check in with me, say something along the lines of \"Hey, I noticed you bought an oven mitt! Would it be alright if I use it too?\" I did gently raise that to her in person, to which she got super defensive and shut down, saying \"Well I don't know what I'm supposed to use anymore\".\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "This is a throwaway account because people I know know my real acct. I need a perspective on this outside of my family to know if I'm not treating this event with enough importance.\n\nSo my sister had the first baby of our family and we're all so happy about it, but she's also treating her kid like he should be the center of our universe. Examples being constantly spamming our group texts with photos of him, turning EVERY conversation to be about him, etc.  \nThis attitude is supported by her husband's parents and both of my parents. My sister and her husband are having a big birthday party in 3 weeks for his first birthday and expecting us to be a there.\n\nI begrudgingly bought tickets to fly for the event a month ago. I'm gonna be honest: While I LOVE my nephew, I was already kindof dreading the party even though I'm willing to go through with it just to show support. There are a LOT of jerks amongst my sister's friends and her husbands family (these will be the majority of the 50ish guests present). I also find giant celebrations for a baby who will not remember it to be obnoxious. I would much rather just send a gift and celebrate my nephew in a visit one-on-one vs. spend $$$ on a plane ticket for an event where I socially suffer and I don't even really get to have real quality time with my nephew.\n\nAnother thing is that now an important work engagement is coming up for that same week. I'm considering canceling my plane ticket because I don't see how I can make it work without losing out on an important opportunity with my career.  \nMy parents shamed me pretty hard when I mentioned my feelings on it to them privately *(\\*\\*\\*EDIT: \"feelings on it\" meaning that I can't make it happen due to work, NOT my frustration about treating nephew like he's center of the universe)*, and they said I needed to still go to this because it's a big deal for him to turn 1 year old. Like I get that it's a big deal for the grandparents to be there, but me? I just don't really see why it's so important. Please help me see the other side of this - am I being unreasonable if I don't go?\n\nFAQ Notes based on comments I'm getting:\n\n1. I love my nephew and am not jealous of him lol. I am struggling with every conversation getting hijacked into more variations of the same sentiments about what he's doing every second of the day. I want to hear what other family members have going on too and it feels exhausting to get inundated with so many similar/same pics and comments all day every day.\n2. My parents shamed me because they said the baby would \"miss\" me being there. I have not told my parents or sister that I find the nephew oversharing obnoxious. I am keeping that to myself and only shared that here because it's an honest part to the dynamics and personal frustrations.\n3. the plane tickets are roughly $400 and does not include food, transportation and accommodation. It's definitely a financial sting but not totally threatening. I don't need to take off work as I can do remotely but I would be missing out on an in-person opportunity back home which is the bigger sting.\n4. I have met the baby 4 times now and will continue to make lots of efforts to see him if that matters.",

      "body": "My sister (30s) is a social worker. My husband and I (30s) are foster parents. We are currently long term foster parents (and possibly foster to adopt) for biological siblings. The siblings lost their sole parent a couple of years ago. They have half siblings from said parent who are much older, now adults to be exact. Our foster kids miss their half siblings and have craved a relationship with them. But the half siblings have chosen not to have contact and from the limited info we know about our foster kids lives before they came to live with us, any visits that were had while the half siblings were minors, it had to be forced on the older kids who did not wish to keep contact.\n\nThis has been extremely difficult for our foster children and we have advocated for them to be in therapy, which luckily was approved and they go once a week. But they often ask about and bring up their half siblings and beg for us to set up time for them to see them.\n\nMy sister is aware of this and has spoken out to my husband and myself three different times about how we need to do more to ensure this relationship between siblings. We have told her that's not possible. She told us we are failing our foster kids. She said we need to find out the info of these half siblings and fight for contact. She told us we could bring it to court if we need to. I reminded her that's not something we can do. She told me the kids will never see us as parents or want to be in our family if we keep them from their siblings. And then she went on and about how important sibling relationships are and brought up the fact she's a social worker and \"she knows how these things work better than anyone in the family\".\n\nI told her that just because she's a social worker it doesn't mean she always knows what's best for foster kids. I told her she also has no control over adult decisions that are made. Which is something she should know as a social worker. She told me I should take her professional advice and stop invalidating her profession and experience like I did just there.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "I (25F) work at a lab where gossip is a hot topic. All of my coworkers love to talk and gossip about each other, but never want to acknowledge their secrets. Well, recently I got accepted into Med School, which has been my dream. I kept it under wraps that I was even trying for fear of people putting negative energy on my goals. Once I was accepted, I told my boss and put in my two-week notice. Here's where it gets interesting. There is an older woman who works there, about 55 years old. She has some kind of vendetta against me. Always trying to make me look bad or incapable. So during my final week, my boss planned to get breakfast for everyone and also got me a farewell card for everyone to sign. The old lady decided not to join everyone for breakfast as she didn't want to be a part of the festivities. However, she had enough interest to take the leftover breakfast food for herself after we were done and went on break. One of my coworkers also got me a farewell cake, congratulating me on Med School, which she also decided not to join us. One coworker would go around calling me Dr. all day, which I think only fed into the old lady's feelings. This is when I found out that the old lady was huffing and puffing all week because everyone was giving me attention. She even went to the extent of telling others that she doesn't think I can make it in Med School. Who openly says that, especially in the workplace? I was so mad when I heard this. She said it on two different occasions and tried to get other people to agree with her, but they chose to stay out of it. I haven't been able to confront her yet, but WIBTA if I decide to give her a piece of my mind?",

      "body": "Need some objective feedback to determine if I’m being unreasonable.  My husband started his own company 1 1/2 years ago.  The company markets largely to people with families, but not exclusively.  My husband pays a marketing company to do social media posts.  Generally I think these posts are often cringey, they are impersonal and like to post on random national holidays which feels spammy/disingenuous to me.  I’ve told my husband this and he doesn’t care because he doesn’t like posting on social media.  Obviously that’s fine, it’s his company and he can do what he wants.\n\nHowever, there have been a few times that the marketing company has posted photos of me and/or my son (less than a year old) on these random holidays (most recently, “National Parents Day”) without asking me.  I told him I prefer the marketing company doesn’t post photos of us.  I don’t mind if he posts these himself, because those posts are more genuine, but when the marketing company does it is obvious, impersonal, and feels like I’m in a stock photo.\n\nHe is mad about this.  He says those posts get the most leads and it will hurt his business.  I told him just to post those ones himself, and he said he does not like posting and it takes him a long time and stresses him out.  AITA for not wanting his marketing company to post photos of my family?\n\nOn top of this, I am the primary provider right now for our family since my husband has been starting his business.  I asked my husband to start contributing about 1K toward expenses in the next couple of months.  He is now saying that because of the above boundary I set, he is just going to fire the marketing company altogether which will cost him 1K a month in sales and therefore he can no longer contribute toward our family expenses.  I told him it’s not necessary to fire the marketing company altogether but he says the family photos get the most leads so it doesn’t make sense to have the company post social media posts if they can’t do family photos.  I told him he could just do it and he refuses.\n\nAny thoughts/feedback would be appreciated.  I understand his frustration but I think he’s being dramatic.  Please let me know if I’m being unreasonable.  Thank you.",

      "body": "My dad practically gave me up to his sister from the moment I (27M) was born. My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. \n\nIt hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me “killing” her and he can’t stand to look at my face. \n\nYou can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That’s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. \n\nMy aunt doesn’t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that’s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn’t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn’t matter because we’re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It’s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn’t know the real reason about why we’re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. \n\nBut he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of “life stuff.” It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. \n\nI told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma’s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it’s been put in jeopardy. \n\nMy dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn’t agree at all with what he did and it could’ve been avoided if I didn’t say anything. \n\nFor me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious. I couldn’t ignore what happened after what it did. Idk if it was the right call since it put their whole marriage at risk after all.",

Over the past week she's been waking up angry, I'm talking stomping around the house raising her voice and slamming things on tables angry. And each day there's something new that triggers her getting mad as soon as she wakes up. Most of the time I go to sleep after her due to insomnia so every time she gets up and is yelling/stomping it wakes me up and puts me in a bad mood due to ptsd from my childhood cuz my father would do the same thing. \nAnyways this morning I was the reason and I'm not sure what to do or if I was even in the wrong. So this morning I rolled over half asleep and threw my arm around her to snuggle like we do every morning and she seemed to be startled awake. Immediately after she let's out an irritated sigh and gets up aggressively and starts putting on her dress saying she needed to pee. I know what that sigh usually means so I let her use the bathroom and when she came back I tried snuggling up to her again but she was just on her phone and after a long awkward silence she said why she had gotten upset. \nShe said that she was having a \"really good dream about her mother and wanted to see where it went\" and she was mad at me because I woke her up. I told her there's no possible way I could've known and she proceeded to tell me to just leave her alone when she's sleeping. This shocked me cuz we're a very affectionate couple and physical touch is my love language. \nShe takes psych meds and I'm not sure she's been taking them cuz this is sorta how she acts when she runs out but idk what to do. Wherever i bring up her taking her meds she gets defensive but she has lied about taking them before when she hasn't. She's been in bed with her head under the covers like she does when she's mad for a few hours now and I'm not sure if I should leave her alone or try to talk to her again about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated \n\nEdit: i forgot to mention her mother is no longer with us. It's been about three or four years since she passed so I understand why it's still a sensitive subject",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to sell my horse?",
      "body": "Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. \n\nI’ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she’s been mine ever since. She’s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.\n\nWhen I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn’t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. \n\nAt first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I’m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he’ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn’t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I’m always rushing around her.\n\nThen last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I’ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she’s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn’t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. \n\nSo I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I’m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful ❤️\n\n[Update here](https://www.reddit.com/user/nohorsethrow/comments/snfhxm/update_aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_horse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

      "body": "My grandparents, who adopted and raised me, recently passed away within a year of each other. My siblings and I received $600 checks from their estate. It certainly isn’t life changing, but helpful, especially in this economy. \n\nMy mom texted to ask if she could have the money (not a loan) to put towards the mortgage on my grandparent’s house. She hopes to move into it someday, but it won’t be for a couple of years. This is not the house that any of us grew up in, as my grandparents only purchased it about two years ago, so there are no childhood memories within those walls. In fact, she had not even seen the house in person until my grandmother’s funeral. \n\nMy mom has a stable, well-paying career, but often struggles financially due to lifestyle choices. She tends to spend money on luxury items and services and has a history of making financial decisions that seem impulsive or unsustainable. It is certainly her right to keep her hair and nails done, pay for plastic surgery, purchase five expensive Golden Retrievers, etc. However, while my husband and I live comfortably, we cannot continue to be her personal bank. \n\nJust this past December, she called me on New Year’s Eve to ask for a loan to get her newest husband on an emergency flight to make a court date they claimed was “unexpected”. While my children watched the fireworks, I was trying to help her out and get a flight booked. The loan has not been paid back, though knowing her, it honestly wasn’t expected.\n\nI’m a teacher and just moved to a new school that doesn’t have as many resources as the last did. I’d love to use the money to buy class sets of novels and live plants for my classroom and/or do something super fun with my children this summer. \n\nI’m also not sure how she plans to continue to pay the mortgage on the house until she moves in, and worry that I’ll be out $600 and the bank will get the house anyway. \n\nWIBTA if I say no?",

      "body": "A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.\n\nWe started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.\n\nCue a question I drew: \"What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?\"\n\nSome backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.\n\nI didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, \"Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.\" \n\nEveryone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said \"well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.\"\n\nIf things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",

She was understanding.\n\nHowever, when my mom got home and I explained my situation, she accused me of faking it and called me lazy and useless. She compared me unfavorably to my older brothers, saying they're good at everything. When I tried to calmly explain how I felt, she yelled at me. I lost my temper, called her a bitch, and ran off crying.\n\nTo make matters worse, my dad and brothers seem to think I'm being unreasonable and that I should just \"toughen up\" and deal with it. Since then, I've been ignoring my mom and acting like she doesn't exist. I'm also considering staying with my grandparents for a while to cool off.

      "body": "My little brother is 18. I'm 20. I am staying with my family for the holidays and thought it'd be a nice time but I forgot that they treat me like a housekeeper. I do almost all the chores and I don't mind if its MY chore. Obviously, if I notice the dishwashers full, I empty it. If I cook, I clean up. If I make a mess, I clean up. However, if my little brother makes a mess. He makes me clean up. If I refuse and tell him to do it himself, he tells my parents and they side with him and just bug me until I do it. \n\nMy brother also asks me to cook for him. He pulls out brownie mix and is like \"make this.\" I always am like: \"Sure, I can make it but you have to help.\" He gets mad and says \"I helped by taking out the box!\" And when I refused to make stuff for him or tell him to make it himself, he'll throw a fit and tell our parents. \n\nLately, he keeps asking me to make stuff and I get frustrated going back and forth about why can't he make shit himself or just ask our parents. So I make the food he asks, but I always add stuff he doesn't like. (coincidentally, he hates a ton of stuff I love to eat ) So if he asks for brownies and refuses to help, I put nuts in it. He hates them and I like them. He came over to see the brownies and got mad at me and told me he hated nuts and can't eat the brownies anymore. I just said, \"too bad, make it yourself next time or help me and tell me not to put nuts in.\" I thought he'd learn his lesson to at least help but he keeps asking for stuff and I just keep putting stuff in that he doesn't like.\n\nHe finally got fed up and said he's not eating because I keep making stuff with stuff he doesn't like. I just shrugged and told him to make his own food then. He told my parents of course and they just told me to stop being an asshole and make food for him. It was my last day at home so I just told them to make food for him if they're so concerned before I left. Now my parents are upset with me and my brother is angry with me and I am wondering if I was too petty",

      "body": "AITA Our neighbors well dried up and we cut them off from using our water.\n\nWe live in a suburban country neighborhood (USA). All the homes are on well / septic. There are original 1960's ranchers with a few newer larger 90's homes sprinkled throughout. We're in a newer 90's house and the neighbors are in one of the original homes. We each have two low yield wells and one of theirs has been dried up since before they bought the home.\n\nLast week their good well stopped working and they asked my Wife if they could fill up buckets for their animals (more on this later) and garden. In the vein of being a good neighbor she naturally said yes. They've had a well company out and have been messing with both their wells on their own. But these past few days there's been no work being done and they've provided no update. My wife asked what was up the other day and they said that they have basically been getting the run around by various well companies and they don't have time to pursue this harder. Everyday it's multiple 5 gallon buckets in the morning and evening that they're filling with our hose. Probably 20-30 gallons each fill up.\n\nIt's 2 adults and 8 kids in their home, a large garden and a large (illegal) number of chickens and turkeys. They've clearly brought this on themselves with heavy irresponsible water use. \n\nThey have a bunch of roosters that are not legal and are driving the neighborhood crazy. So I've been kind of irritated that we're supporting the obnoxious rooster operation. Also obviously worried the increase use on our aquifer will mess our water flow up. But it's pretty cold to say \"Hey you can't fill up your buckets any more, your on your own\" so we've been wrestling with what to do.\n\nYesterday they had an older lady walking around their yard yelling and praying for the wells to open up. This was the last straw for us. In my opinion this is a serious problem that requires a serious, timely solution and they've got a lady basically doing a rain dance. \n\nLast night my Wife told the Mom next door that we can't provide water any more and that we could give them another 24hrs of water use to figure it out and the Mom got upset and walked away from my Wife while she was speaking to her. Which makes us feel better about our choice, basically F them, they're rude and ungrateful but again still obviously we feel bad about cutting off a house full of kids from water use. Also none of the other neighbors are going to help because they're upset about the roosters so they're on their own now. AITAH?\n\n",

      "body": "English is not my first language, so please, forgive me for any mistakes and expressions that don't make as much sense in english. \n So, me 46M am a lawyer. In my country, you go straight into the degree you want once you get out of high school and pass a test. During college, I met this friend, also 46M. We were in the same classes and got along greatly for years. We know each other for about 28 years now. He was one of my groomsmen at my wedding. \n  \nAfter I graduated, I did a 2 year postgraduate degree while I worked. My friend always said that experience was better than a diploma. I never minded it since he never pressed it. When I met my wife, 43F, she was just starting at the firm I worked at. We hit it off pretty well and started dating soon after. 3 years after I finished my postgraduate program, I started my masters. My wife and I started to plan on opening our own law firm around this time, seeing as she was also pushing for her postgraduate. \n  \nSome years later, we finally managed to open our firm. The friend in question was there at the opening party for the firm and seemed happy for me at the time. Some years went by and, when I was around 38, I finally got my doctorate. Now, 8 years later, I'm a very good family/contract lawyer (even if I say so myself). \n \nNow, to the main issue of the post. Last weekend, mine and my wife's friends were around at our house, having a little barbecue. Some time close to the end of our get together, this friend asked me how much was my hourly rate, because he wanted to start going the independent route. I told him the value (kinda high, but again, I know I'm worth it), and he said I charged too much for my services. I said something among the lines of: \"When you're as qualified as I am, you can charge the same or even higher.\"\n  \nHe was kinda silent/uncomfortable and the party kinda died after that. My wife talked to me yesterday saying that some people thought the tone of my comment was kinda rude, even if I didn't mean it, and that I should talk to him. I didn't want to get seen as passive-aggressive with my response, I just answered his question. Am I wrong? Should I apologize?",

My mom is a doctor so she was super paranoid about my family living with her during the pandemic, but as things where I live are settling down she let us come stay with her again. \n\nMy stepmom has known me for two years and our relationship has always been weird. She’s a nice person but she can be pretty mean and childish if we do something she doesn’t like. She also has a tendency to run to our dad if she hears something bad about us. \n\nLong story short, I have a diary and I keep a lot of private stuff in it. Dad called me a few days ago (we were visiting with our mom) saying he has to talk to me when I come back. Apparently I was in trouble because of something I apparently said to stepmom. \n\nWhen he told me what she said I said, I immediately recognized it because I wrote it in my diary. I realized a lot of the stuff I wrote down was stuff she was telling him, so I decided to come up with a plan to see if I was write. I wrote a fake entry basically saying stuff I would never do in a million years and set the trap.\n\nDad calls me while out visiting with friends, and when I come back he grounds me for what I “did”. Stepmom comes in later, apologized and said it sounded “concerning” and she had to tell. \n\nI told her it was fake, knew she read my diary and refused to speak to her. My dad came in and tried to talk to me and I told him that stepmom was reading my diary and he didn’t believe me. \n\nNow I’m with my mom, and I don’t know if what I did was fair. I felt it was the only way to prove my point and I didn’t know what else to do. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: wow thank you so much for the award! I honestly didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, but I just want to thank all of you for your support and ideas. A lot of people have been saying to either get a licking diary or an online diary, so I'm looking into that. in the mean time I am currently staying with my mom and I am trying to as long as possible. Overall, I just want to thank you for the kind messages (and bright ideas) that you've given me. Reddit is truly magical <3",

We do not live together and Ann has never liked me because I'm \"boring\". She has said this to my face. So Dave thinks it will be good. I didnt really want either of them to go but thought what the hell, why not. This could be good for us. Boy was I fucking wrong. From the moment Ann got in to my vehicle she started complaining about absolutely everything. It was too crowded, too loud, we were taking too many stops, the boys were \"too annoying\" and \"need to quiet the fuck down and chill out\". \n\nWe get a hotel 9 hours in (PA). Its around 3pm at this point. Dave asks if he can take a drive with Ann because she was getting irritated with the kids. I told him he could if he makes it quick because I needed to go get dinner supplies. 3 hours later he shows back up. Him and Ann went out to eat. So I make a comment saying \"you didnt think we wanted to eat too?\" And Ann snaps back with \"I dont think we asked.\" \n\nAfter comments like this for days I finally snapped. My body are now saying they just want to go home because several times Dave told my kids to be quiet because of his kids comfortability. At this point I havent done anything with my kids because the queen would have a fit if we pulled off anywhere AND Dave at this point basically refused to let me drive despite me arguing. IN MY CAR. So I snapped, told him to pull the fuck over. When he finally does, I drive to the nearest car rental and tell them to get the fuck out of my car. Dave and Ann both start flipping out. Ann saying she isnt going to get in a car that has \"bed bugs\". Dave saying he didnt want to take separate vehicles and didnt have enough money for a rental because the queen spent over $1500 in 4 days. So I say \"I dont believe I fucking asked.\" And take off. They were close to 800 miles from home. It took them 4 days to get home due to lack of money and needing to borrow. I'm being told I'm a selfish cunt. AITA?",

I bought a cup and was about to let both Andy and Matt start feeding the horses when Carl said Matt might accidentally get bitten. The farm does have a sign saying they aren’t responsible if the horses bite or spit on you. So it probably has happened or the people working there think it could happen. Carl said it would be better not to let Matt get too close to them, since he isn’t a particularly careful boy. I figured he was right.\n\nSo only Andy got to feed the horses. When Matt told Jeff about this, he got upset and said we over worried, and that Matt would have had a better day if we just let him take part in the activity.",

      "body": "Link to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e6ls16/aita_for_making_my_family_cancel_their_vacation/).\n\nMy brother apologized and we were having a very good and calm conversation. We were getting to a point where I was willing to make a compromise because I finally felt heard.\n\nThen my SIL, who had had an attitude the whole time, snappily said \"okay so what do we need to do to resolve this\". Things started to get heated because I felt her tension and tried to acknowledge it.\n\nI said that I was really hurt by my SILs actions. I left it out of my og post, but she was complaining about helping me clean my house before my wedding. I later found out that she told my dad that I had moldy dishes in the sink and that was humiliating. I said it hurt a lot when I learned she brought it up again as part of her argument why I should watch the dogs. She sarcastically said \"oh so I'M the villain\".\n\nI said \"I feel like from what I have gathered from my parents this past week that you think I'm sabotaging this vacation because I'm jealous that I can't go. And if you think that, you really must not know me, and that hurts.\" and she said with the same rude tone as earlier, \"I must not know you because that is 100% what I think.\" My eyes welled up because I felt like she had just suckerpunched me, and she looked at me and said \"Here comes the temper tantrum\".\n\nI stood up to leave. Then I turned around again and said over everyone yelling my name to calm down \"If you with all your time, money, and resources, decide to not go on vacation, that is your own decision and not because of me.\" I got the hell out of the house and sat in the car until my husband came out.\n\nShe was in my wedding. I have been so happy to have her as my SIL. I have been nothing but loving to her. Now I see she doesn't give a fuck about me. I'm gutted. It's clear that she has zero respect for me and probably never even liked me. I'm devastated because my family is everything, and I feel like my relationship with my brother will forever be altered. She is not the person I thought she was, and now I'm not only NOT watching the dogs, but I guess I am also accepting that I don't have a sister like I thought I did.",

      "body": "I (20F) wanted to celebrate my 20th birthday in the best way possible with my friends while not wasting too much money. \n\nOur first idea was to book a hotel somewhere in our country near the beach but the prices were ridiculously expensive and bc most of us are still uni-students, we couldn’t afford it.\n\nI still wanted to make my birthday special since I never really celebrated it properly (the last time I did anything special was when I was like 11) and to have the chance to bring the friend group back together for a few days since we’ve all grown apart.\n\nI opened a group chat to discuss our options and the best one was to take an Airbnb that’s big enough for us all that would also be near the beach. We found the best Airbnb we could find, the price was good and the house by itself looked great.\n\nBut then, my friend Mia (21F) have announced in the group that if we decide to go to an Airbnb and not a hotel she’s not gonna go. I asked her why and she said she found Airbnb’s disgusting and non-classy. (Her exact words, she also said “I wouldn’t even step into an Airbnb because she doesn’t trust they even change the sheets.) I told her I’ve been to multiple Airbnb’s and they were all clean, and the reviews on the one we wanted were all good. She continued to argue so I told her that it’s my birthday and as much as I want everyone to be in it, I’m not going to bend to her conditions and pay a lot of money im trying to save.\n\nThere was a big drama (because everyone disagreed with her), we all have stopped talking in the group which made me think that now our plans would be cancelled because everyone were upset by the argument.\n\nI shared my bf (24M) about the situation and he decided to pull some strings and use some of his connections. He got us a huge discount on one of the best hotels in our country, but their condition was that we can’t be more than two people in each room. (They basically didn’t want us to take the big rooms that were meant for groups).\n\nWithout Mia, we were exactly six people so it was perfect. I told everyone about the situation in the group chat and for some reason Mia was sure one of our friends would give up their place so she could go.\n\nI’ve had enough with her attitude, so I straight up told her i don’t want her to come because if she does, we will be an un-even number and we will have to go to the Airbnb anyways. She cursed at me, left the group and haven’t talked to any of us since. We’re going to the hotel in two days and I just feel really bad with what I did and with how everything turned out because it was the last thing I wanted to happen. We are MIA’s only friends and all of us will be together without her.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n",

      "body": "I (23F) have ongoing issues with my 22 year old brother being treated like a child while I’m expected to act like his second mom. This has been a pattern in our house for years and here’s the most recent example that sums it up.\n\nLast night there were leftovers in tupperware on the stove. My brother wanted to boil pasta so he moved the container to the counter and started boiling water. I asked politely if he could put the leftovers in the fridge. He ignored me. I waited a bit and asked if he heard me. He huffed, grabbed something else and walked toward the fridge. I said again “not that I said can you please put the leftovers in the fridge.” He snapped that he didn’t hear me and I said he could’ve asked me to repeat it. He started shoving the container into an overcrowded fridge without making space, knocking things over. I told him to stop—yeah a little rudely because I was annoyed—and he slammed the tupperware on the counter so hard food spilled out onto the counter and floor. Even more annoyed I told him to clean it up and he said no it was my fault. I had to ask him three more times before he actually cleaned it and even then he left paper towel bits and food residue everywhere so I still had to clean up after him.\n\nWhen I told our mom the next day she said I was wrong for not teaching him how to properly store leftovers. She yelled at me that of course he got mad because who likes their older sister bossing them around and I had no right to be upset if I’m not showing him how to fix the problem. She said he’ll never learn otherwise. This exact argument happens all the time. A few times a month minimum. He constantly leaves messes. Like I said he didn’t even clean up all the paper towel after the spill. That kind of stuff happens daily. He uses the air fryer for almost every meal and always leaves crumbs in and around it. I tell him every week. He’s been taught how to clean it. Still doesn’t. He leaves hair and water all over the bathroom sink. He’s been told to clean it and still never gets it all. He’s never put away laundry I always do it. He’s never swept or mopped or actually cleaned anything. Yard work? He avoids it and the yard looks awful.\nHe doesn’t work. I do. I cook clean and keep the house going while he does the bare minimum if that. And anytime I complain or get frustrated I get treated like I’m crazy. My mom yells at me constantly but when it comes to him she either says nothing or speaks super nicely.\nEven when she sees him ignoring stuff or doing it wrong she still blames me. Says I can’t expect him to know if he’s never been taught. WERE ALMOST THE EXACT SAME AGE I DON’T UNDERSTAND IF I KNOW WHY…\n\nSo yeah. AITA for thinking I shouldn’t have to teach a grown adult how to function like a normal human being?\n",

I don't have an eye socket I could put a fake eye in, it's just normal skin and some scars on a big pach of my face (they reconstructed my face with a later surgery this way). The right side and the bottom half of my face is completely normal. \n\nI have big side bangs that hide the left side of my face so I don't freak anyone out and I don't get weird looks. I've been going to the same school since I was 5, so the teachers and the kids know about it. \n\nWe got a new teacher this week. He started by asking us to go around and introduce ourself. When it got to me, he was rude and asked me \"do your parents know you come to school looking like this? It's extremely disrespectful, fix your bangs, I want to see your face!\" \n\nSo I obeyed and tucked my bangs behind my ear, showing the left side of my face. He gasped, his face turned red, my classmates laughed and he told me that I can let my bangs down. \n\nLater that day, my head teacher came to me to scold me. She told me I was wrong to \"shock\" the new teacher and I should've just told him about it. \n\nDid I do anything wrong? I just obeyed his orders, it's not my fault he ended up not wanting to look at my face. AITA?\n\n-----\nUpdate:\n\nMy mom went in to talk to the head teacher. It turned out that the new teacher made it sound like I was playing a prank on him, trying to deliberately shock him and make fun of him in front of the class. 3 of my classmates had to be called in to confirm my part of the story. \n\nThe head teacher apologized, called it an unfortunate misunderstanding and told us she will clear it up with the new teacher, I don't have to worry about it. I don't believe it was just a \"misunderstanding\", it sounds like the new teacher deliberately lied, but we can't do anything about it...",

      "body": "I (40F) have been with my husband (43M) for several years. He has a daughter (13F) from a previous relationship. When we started dating and I was introduced to her, he made it very clear that she already had parents and didn’t need another one—what she needed was an advocate and mentor. I was absolutely fine with that and have always tried to respect those boundaries.\n\nFor the most part, our relationship is good. She’s a great kid. Now, we also have a son together (3M). He’s my first and only biological child, and I had wanted him for a very long time.\n\nHere’s the issue:\n\nI had a very specific vision for my son’s room that I’d planned well in advance. I painted two ombre walls that go from grass green to sky blue and transition into a dusty blue ceiling covered in glow-in-the-dark stars. His ceiling light has a sun-shaped lampshade, and his nightlight is a moon. He has a Montessori-style floor bed designed to look like a tent, a grassy rug, a ball pit that looks like a pool, tree trunk–shaped toy chests that double as chairs and a table, and a tree-shaped bookshelf. I paid for all of this myself.\n\nWhen it came to my stepdaughter’s room, we asked her what she wanted. She said she wanted a reading nook, so we created one with a small round mattress, a ton of cushions in her favorite colors, and a mosquito net canopy. She chose her wall colors (solid block shades), and we did the room together. We split the cost 50/50. The rest of the furniture in her room was purchased by my husband before I came into the picture, and he doesn’t see any point in replacing it since it’s still in good condition. As a result, I didn’t have much say in that space.\n\nRecently, after seeing my son’s room fully set up, my stepdaughter got upset. She said I clearly put way more effort into his space than hers and accused me of playing favorites because he's “actually mine.” I tried to explain that I didn’t want to overstep when it came to her room and that she made most of the choices herself. But now she feels hurt and like I don't care as much about her.\n\nI do feel guilty because I can see how, from her perspective, it looks unfair. But I also don’t know how to navigate doing more without violating the boundaries my husband and I set early on. I’m not her parent, and I didn’t want to push decisions onto her room. At the same time, I now wonder if I should have tried harder or been more involved.\n\nSo Reddit… AITA?",

For two years he’s been in a relationship with Heather (20f) and since they started dating, her and I have been really good friends, almost inseparable. I also have a boyfriend of 4 years, and all of us hang out fairly often.\n\nWhen we were like 13, Josh had a phase where he was really into woodworking and he made me a small wooden bowl.  I keep it on my bathroom counter and put my earrings in. I like it a lot and it’s a cute memento from my childhood. \n\nAbout a week ago, Heather and I were getting ready to go Christmas shopping. I was doing my makeup in the bathroom when she pointed out the bowl and asked where it came from. I’m guessing Josh mentioned it to her, because the way she asked it was like she knew the answer, idk how else to describe it, but it was almost accusatory, like she had just caught me doing something I shouldn’t be doing. I told her it was from Josh when we were like 13. She then told me, “well, since he’s my boyfriend, I think I should have it now” I told her no, that he made it for me when we were kids, and I didn’t want to give it away. \n\nShe started arguing with me about it and I asked her to leave lol because I could not reason with her. Since then I’ve tried to reach out to her and she hasn’t responded. I haven’t tried to reach out to Josh at all because I feel like it just wouldn’t be appropriate and I don’t know how much of this situation he knows about, if he agrees with her, and anything else. My boyfriend agrees that I shouldn’t have to give it to her and of course he and Josh have talked but not about this. It’s just a very awkward situation, and I’m wondering, am I the asshole for not giving my friends girlfriend a gift he made for me when we were young?",

      "body": "Background about my husband : He stays up late at night and has to wake up early to go to work. So when he gets home at 5, he has to get his 2hrs nap so he could both make up for lack of sleep and also be ready to stay up late to play with his console. \n\nHe values his sleep and has one rule in the house that he enforces strictly, which is to not be interrupted while sleeping. He literally put a sign on the bedroom door saying 'DO.NOT.WAKE.ME.UP\" under any circumstances, just no, unless someone's hurt or dead though; in this case he said he still wouldn't be of much help anyway. The kids and I would sometimes wake him up but for serious reasons. He got mad and started locking the door. I get no access to the room for 2 hours but that's not the main problem.\n\n\nThis past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.\n\n\nI could be wrong for what I've done but I was frustrated and mad. AITA?",

      "body": "I share custody of a moody, emotional, cranky 11yo boy with his mom. I am very mindful and respectful that he's hitting puberty and give him space and boundaries. One minute he will give you the death stare for being in the same room and the next minute he'll want to play fight because he knows I'm going to hug and kiss him.\n\nRight now Ethan going through a phase where he doesn't any adult relative posting any picture or video of him on their social media account. The of exceptions is if you're between the ages of 14 to 25 and doing something fun or makes him look cool.\n\nHis mom and stepdad love posting pictures of their family all the time. Ethan told them not to post pictures of him. His stepdad told him to not post family pictures without him is like letting him not shower or brush his teeth. It's sorta required.\n\nMy son complained to me and I said I'm not getting involved with how they run their home. To me, it's not a hill worth dying over. Ethan let them know how he felt. \n\nI had Ethan all week and he goes back to his mom's on Saturday. He refuses to go back because he doesn't want to go to the family Labor Day camping trip where he'll be photographed. I asked my son if this was really worth fighting over and he believes so.\n\nI spoke to his mom and she thought it was ridiculous. I said I agree but this is just some weird tween boy power trip thing so just promise not to take his picture. She refused. Now Ethan refuses to go on the trip.\n\nLast night his stepdad and maternal uncle called him separately. Both times resulted in Ethan crying. They basically told him his ass was going. That pissed me off. I called them both up and said my custody issues with his mom is none of their business. I agree it's stupid and a compromise could had been met. Now that you all inserted yourself into the matter, I have no choice but to let him stay here if he wants. \n\nHis mom is mad at ME. I told her to just drop it and you can take him for a few extra days when you get back. The situation has gotten too dramatic. It's not like he doesn't want to go back because he has to clean his room. He has to know that his stepdad and uncle are not calling the shots too. She is furious at me and says I'm encouraging bad behavior by letting him stay here. Ironically I'm way more strict than she is. \n\nEdit: This has nothing to do with taking his picture. He loves having his picture taking with the older kids or the young adults because he think it makes him look cool. Anything to do with older people makes him feel like he's 5.\n",

      "body": "I 35F was scheduled to go on a camping trip with my older brother his 2 daughters age 12 and 14 and my younger sister in 12 days. My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no. So I feel that if I go on this trip it will absolutely not be the relaxing trip I have been looking forward to for months.\nWould I be the asshole if I tell my sister I will not be joining them for this trip?\n\nupdate: first of all thank you for the comments. I did want to clear a couple of things up my younger sister does not have any kids and the 6 year old as he is bringing is our youngest brothers kid. Many have pointed out that screaming fits is not a symptom of ADHD and that is correct her ADHD causes her to be hyper and really high energy the temper tantrums are a separate issue. I have not spoken to my sister yet as today is a holiday and I did not want to ruin it for anyone, but today she informed my brother that my niece will not be allowed to bring her tablet as my sister has decided this is a no electronics trip. This is a recipe.for disaster as my niece does not do well on long rides and usually uses her tablet. The ride to the campsite is 3 hours and my sister is expecting my niece to sit quietly. This was a conversation that she made sure to have while my older brother was out of earshot so I will be letting him know what she is planning and will not be going on this trip. My plan is to spend that time at a resort and spa instead",

      "title": "WIBTA if I move out before my roommate's lease is up because she doesn't respect me or my boundaries.",
      "body": "I (27F) live with my childhood best friend (28F) and her boyfriend (27). She also has a 5 year old son (my Godson). Our apartment is a 2 bedroom 2 bath with a den, the den is my godson's room. We pay $650 each. When we applied for the apartment, it was initially going to be just us two and her son. I emphasized how I would prefer the master because the other two bedrooms are right next to each other and will share a restroom but she was so adamant on having a stand in shower that she wouldn't budge.\n\nNow, the lease is in her name, however she could not get this apartment without me, as I paid the application and admin fee, deposit, first month's rent (which she still hasn't paid me back for), and helped her meet the income requirements with an offer letter. Since I do not have children, I set the boundary before we moved in that her son will only have three chances to mess up in my restroom before he is banned. Well, he has peed on my floor and the toilet seat more than FIVE times. When I went to tell her, she turned the situation to where she was upset and said I \"keep complaining about it.\" She agreed that he will use her restroom during the day and mine at night. I disagreed and said do not give him food or drinks before bed and put him on a schedule, but she did not respect that and nothing has changed.\n\nI also have told her to not use my glass tupperware because I meal prep. Meanwhile, some days I open the fridge and see the food they cooked in my containers, so I have to then wait for them to eat their leftovers to meal prep. I had a new coworker over for lunch and her boyfriend literally scolded me in front of him saying to not bring strangers or people you just met over.\n\nThey don't wash the dishes for days at a time and now we have gnats in our very brand new and expensive apartment. They eat and drink my things and go into my restroom and room when I am not here. Lastly, she told me the apartments don't take money orders and had me cash app her the rent. That didn't sit right with me so I called and asked and they definitely do take money orders. All of this is just a lot to deal with and as someone who has known me since 5th grade, I expected her to treat me better than this.\n\nTLDR: I (27F) live with my childhood best friend (28F), her boyfriend, and her 5-year-old son in a 2 bed/2 bath apartment (my godson sleeps in the den). Although the lease is in her name, I covered all move-in costs and helped her qualify for the apartment. I’ve set boundaries, like her son not using my bathroom due to repeated messes, but they’re constantly ignored. They use my things without permission (glass containers, food), don’t clean up (causing gnats), go into my room when I’m not home, and even lied about rent payment methods. Her boyfriend even scolded me in front of a guest.\n\n  \nEdit: $650 is 1/3 of the rent. It is just an expensive apartment. ",

      "body": "For some context, my mom used to be a tattoo artist 15+ years ago and stopped to pursue another career. Recently, she’s bought fake skin and an Amazon tattoo machine to practice again as a hobby. She doesn’t want to tattoo anymore, just use it for fun. My sister (has a lot of tattoos, and is over 21) told my mom that she wants to learn how to tattoo from home using the fake skin and tattoo machine, and wants to eventually give herself a small tattoo. My mom isn’t against this idea, which I think is weird. I think this a terrible idea all together, I don’t think tattooing actual skin is a hobby, it’s a job for professionals. Also, my sister doesn’t know anything about blood borne pathogen training, and doesn’t know how deep or light to use the tattoo machine. I know some people on tattoo beginners and tattoo scratchers are amazing, but I don’t trust my sister yet to make mistakes. Her lines are a bit shaky and unsaturated. Yesterday, she was practicing on the fake skin, and then decided to give herself some small dots without even changing the needle, which I believe is contamination. She was showing me tattoo designs yesterday and expressed interest in tattooing me, and got upset when I told her I don’t trust her not to scar me. It’s her body and choice to learn how to tattoo herself, but I think it’s a terrible idea. I don’t want to cave and have a terrible tattoo, or for her to tattoo herself and end up hating it (she’s picky about how other artists do her tattoos). If I told her to stop trying to learn how to tattoo at home, WIBTA? \n\nEdit- Okay, I agree with everyone. Reading this post back, I might be a bit judgy, and I’m sorry for that. I won’t tell her what to do, it’s not my decision. I’m just more scared about tattoo infections, and maybe I’m projecting that. Thank you everyone! I do think it’s cool to learn it as a skill, but maybe I’m too judgy about what it takes to be a tattoo artist. I do think it would be cool for my sister to give me a tattoo, but I don’t trust her yet. Thank you everyone! ",

      "body": "My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. \n\nEnter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).\n\nHer kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. \n\nI tried being polite about it \"Sweetie where's your mommy?\" -points to mom- \"Ma'am!\" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says \"I don't wanna\" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. \n\n\nFinally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record \"why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that\" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. \n\nI'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. \"LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!\" \n\nPeople looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "body": "I made a post here almost a year ago (linked here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3zXeRgbU5K), and I am so grateful to the people who took time to comment. I read them all, and I received a lot of messages from people with advice and kind words.\n\nSo, an update: we got married!! A lot of y'all told me to go through with it, and after a lot of thought, we did! When my mom left in October, we were in a bad place, and we were having a lot of really awful phone calls and screaming fights. I was desperate to do something, and I finally found a therapist who helped me process some of the things that happened between my mom and I and my role in things. In the months leading up to the wedding, my mom continued to scream at me over the phone and make threats about choosing \"him or her\" and how she hoped I wasn't the kind of girl who got rid of her family to please a man who would end up leaving her anyway. She was downright hateful, and I spent a lot of time crying over our relationship, because I couldn't believe we had gotten to this point. Even with knowing that some of her disregulation was because of the brain injury, I just couldn't believe my own mom would threaten me, call me a cunt, and tell me that I wasn't allowed to be upset with her because she had been traumatized her whole life.\n\nWe got married in April, and my mom and brother did not attend. I was able to reconnect with my mom's cousin, who I used to be close with as a child, and she and her family came to the wedding. I had my best friend, her family, and my work family there to support me. A close friend performed the ceremony. Plus, of course, my husband's family was very supportive. There were times I missed my mom, and I wanted to see her smile in the audience, but I was ultimately glad that she wasn't there. I would have felt like I had to perform and cater to her every whim, and I am so glad I was able to just have a lovely day with all the people who came to celebrate with us.\n\nJust to reaffirm my feelings about her not being there, my mom did not contact me at all on the day-of and only called me a week later to ask whether I would be sharing any pictures with her. I did send her a few, because I thought a small part of her might care, but all she did was comment on how it looked like a cheap Amazon wedding. She hoped I was happy with my shitty choices and that they were worth the loss of my family.\n\nI miss her constantly, despite all our issues, but I haven't cut her off completely. We've been having a hard time communicating at all right now, and I don't know if it will ever get better. But I am happily married and I don't regret it. Thanks for reading this far, and I appreciate all the kindness and honesty I got from my original post!",

      "body": "On May 16th I cracked my iPad, so I found this mobile service repair guy and he contacted me the same day, met up with me and repaired it. \n\nI had a trip the next day planned for the next week, the screen he put on was faulty and it was his only one. I decided to leave it with him for my trip. After, I contacted him and found out his friend died because of cancer, so I tell him to take a week or two to get back on track. \n\nMay 29th I finally meet up with him and get my iPad back. I got home and realized my volume buttons had stopped working, I’ve had it for 3 hours and I know he had it so it had to be him right? I checked find my iPhone constantly and it hadn’t been turned on since the location never updated. \n\nI attempted multiple times to meet with him in the following weeks, until June 20th hit, when he decided to not even show up, then tried to tell me to go even farther away from my house to repair it. \n\nAnyways, he agrees to come to where I work and work on it there on the 26th of June (I don’t know how long my days could be 8-17hour shifts it varies). it’s now the 26th of June. he tries to get me to meet him elsewhere and I put my foot down, and tell him I’ve been patient and I feel like it’s the least he could do. He told me that he couldn’t fix it in the time he had, and he wanted to keep it to work on it, which I was agreed on. \n\nHe didn’t respond to me until the 1st of July. He makes the remark “it’s going to be a minute, maybe buy a cheap one on amazon for the time being” like I have money as a broke 21 year old.\nDon’t hear from him until I text him on July 7th for an update, says he’s not worked on it. \n\nJuly 17th comes along, I suggest I take back my iPad and just bring it elsewhere and he insists on keeping it. \n\nJuly 21st he tells me it’s ready for pickup. At this point I check find my iPhone and see that my iPad was on for a solid 33 minutes, proving my theory that he didn’t even turn it on. \n\nThe 28th of July hit, I’m getting a bit pissed at this point and we start texting. He starts one of his messages to me with “I’ve got 25 years on you, bud” that really pissed me off. He looks down on me. He spits out a paragraph on how he’s gone above and beyond to make my iPad fully functional, and saying he couldn’t have caused the damage to it. I responded with a not so great text basically starting off saying “don’t start this age bullshit with me, and I don’t care about your sob story, I’m a paying customer and I expect a service. And now I have a broken device after the service so I just want my device back. Etc. he responded that he was done dealing with me, and gave me his email, I contacted it and my mother came to pick up my device with me cause my anxiety was through the roof. But seriously I’m so ripped apart mentally I don’t know if I was in the wrong or not, am I the asshole? \n\nI’ll take the L here, sorry for making it so hard to read and for my tone about it. Hopefully this will make it easier to read to any future readers. ",

      "title": "AITA for bringing my roommate with me when I move?",
      "body": "Alright so\nMe (22m) and my roommate, who we'll call Dawn (20f), have been living together for about a year now. She came to me last November because her dad was wanting to take her to another place entirely and make her live in a closet of some random guy's house (which her dad confirmed later) and she didn't know what to do since she just got stable employment and she'd have to quit her first job ever after a month of working it. Since I was already looking for a place to rent out due to my family situation being godawful, I just kinda took over the house and we've been living here since, pooling our income together and doing the house chores together. I've even been helping her kick a Nicotine addiction, and she's been feeling so much better without it. \n\nMy friend, who we will call Texas (22m), made me an offer out of the blue. He will come pick me up from the town we're in and bring me, 4 hours away, to his town (which has cheaper/more stable housing and more/better jobs). I accepted under the condition that I can bring Dawn with me, because she has nowhere to actually go (her father lives with another guy, her mother is out of the picture, and her boyfriend lives with his parents who hate her). He was skeptical, and decided to do his own little investigation into how Dawn is like. Within 3 short conversations, 2 with me present, he now completely hates her guts because she acts like his ex, who was extremely toxic. Dawn isn't toxic, however. He says that she'll prove to be an anchor and that I should just focus on myself and leave Dawn in the dust. His mother is much more neutral, but even she says that I may have to focus on myself and ditch Dawn if it comes out that she's like what Texas says she's like. I don't want to alienate Texas or his mother, me and him have been brothers since we were 13 and his family are the only people in my life who've treated me like actual family instead of a scapegoat or a possession. I have so many people in my life saying to drop Dawn but I don't want to just leave her to her fate. She wants to make this move with me, even in spite of all the things she'll have to sacrifice. \n\nI come to you all for as much of an unbiased opinion as I could get. Would I be the asshole if I bring my roommate with me? I'll answer any questions anyone gives me in the comments, if anyone even replies. I just don't know what to do here and I'm scared I'll have to let go of some of the only few people in my life who haven't treated me like scum. \n\nEDIT: I should've probably added these bits of information originally, but the comments have gotten me to remember them so I'm adding them now based on some of the more \"popular\" questions\n\n\"Why can't her boyfriend take her in?\" \nHe goes to College and works part time to pay rent to his parents, who he lives with. In fact, we are the only people she knows that has their own place, not even her own parents.\n\n\"Why can't she just go live on her own\" neither of us can right now. \n\nAnother thing I'd like to stress is why Texas is a bit apprehensive of Dawn is purely based off of \"she kinda acts like my ex\", specifically repeating \"drop that bitch and don't let no damn FEMALES control you\". Texas' mother is operating off of whatever he told her, but she contacted me to say \"Do what you and only you want to do. Don't let Texas or Dawn influence you, only go off of your gut and understand that you may have to come here alone. If you want to and you really do feel like you want your roommate to come with you, then go ahead. Don't let either of them make you go one way or the other\". \n\nI'd also like to mention the specifics behind why my roommate, Dawn, is joining me. When I asked my roommate, I was hoping that she would want to come with me, but was fully expecting her to be unwilling to join me on this. To my surprise, she was actually very willing to go along with me, even when I explain absolutely everything she'd be leaving behind. She even suggested selling off a whole bunch of the furniture we had from her dad, who just left everything in his possession behind when he took off. I didn't even think about doing that until she brought it up, and it'll be an amazing boon if we can actually get it all sold. We've contacted her dad to ask if he's ever taking his stuff back and he said \"probably not, just toss it or whatever\" which includes like a couple dozen power tools and most of the furniture the house has.\n\nEDIT 2: So, Texas contacted me yesterday and explained that he went through all the things he was saying and realized that he may have jumped the gun when he was condemning Dawn. He apologized, but said that \"you're an adult and can make your own decisions. If she's like you say she is, that's good. If not, you'll learn a valuable lesson\". I realize the backhandedness of this statement, but as long as we're all working on the same page now, I don't mind.\n\nUPDATE: Me and Dawn have made the decision to delay this whole thing by another year so we can get our finances straight and look through all of our options, in terms of housing. While this whole post is now kinda irrelevant, I would like to make a bit of a confession. From the moment Texas called me to make this deal, I had a gut feeling that I shouldn't take this deal yet. Normally, I don't listen to that feeling and just go with the logical choice, but this post made me realize that I probably should've just listened to that instead of this whole dance we've been doing. Feel free to call me dumb in the comments. I'll update this post if something changes drastically. ",

      "body": "My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.\n\nHe suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",

      "body": "I (18F) have had a constant problem with my mom (37F I think), where she likes to get drunk every other night and blast music all night, preventing me from sleeping. \n\nTonight, I snapped at her when I smelled alcohol on her, with my exact words being \"are you drinking already?\", and she came up to my room asking if she and I could talk. I said no, that I don't feel like talking to her while she's drinking and that she can come back when she's sober. She tried to slide $20 through my door and asked me if I would accept twenty dollars to \"pop a Benny\" (take Benadryl) to go to sleep so she could drunkenly blast music all night. \n\nI refused, and she tried to reason with me. I said I have work at eleven in the morning, and she insisted she would wake me up at nine. I answered that she doesn't get up until past noon when she's drunk the night before, and she pressed on. I basically just said I can't trust her and that she's proven her words are empty. She made me slide her the $20 back, which I didn't mind, and she left. Now she's in the garage pouting about not being able to blast music. \n\nStill, some people on Reddit have sent me DMs when I post things complaining about my mom, saying things like \"she's just being silly\" and \"you'll regret saying things like this when she's dead\". So now I have to know, am I the one being an asshole about her drinking? ",

      "body": "I (19F) have been home from college for about a month now. I live at home with my mom, her boyfriend, my two younger sisters (both 15F), and her boyfriend’s two sons (13M and 12M). I didn’t even know his kids were living here permanently until I got back for summer break. I don’t have a problem with them personally, we barely speak. The only thing is food in this house disappears constantly. It’s not that my mom and her boyfriend don’t buy groceries. They do. But no matter how much food is in the house, it’s gone in a day or two. My younger sister and “stepbrothers” I guess, eat all the time. They’ll eat a full breakfast, lunch, and dinner and then still go downstairs constantly throughout the day and night making snacks, extra meals, or just raiding the fridge. Like, I’m not exaggerating, sometimes they make ten different things between meals.\n\nEven with leftovers, I’ll come home and there’s nothing left. I’ve asked my mom about it, and she’ll say she told them to save me some, but they never do. It’s happened so many times that I just gave up. I started putting food aside before I leave the house, but even then, someone would eat it. So now I’ve started just DoorDashing my own food or cooking my own food and keeping it in my mini fridge from college. I stock it with groceries I buy with my own money and just cook for myself when I need to eat. I don’t touch the shared food anymore, and I don’t ask anyone to share mine.\n\nWhen my mom and her boyfriend are at work, and the fridge is empty and my siblings are hungry because they ate all the food in two days, I don't bat an eye because its not my fault or responsibility. The other day, my mom made a comment about how I “only think about myself” and I should “think about the house as a whole.” My sisters are playing a part in this, but majority of it is on her boyfriend's kids. Before I left for college and they didn't live here, food would last. I told that to my mom and she's like \"they're still growing\" and \"you're just being dramatic because you don't like them living here\". That's not the case at all. I get that maybe I'm wrong for door dashing or cooking food while they're hungry, but I’m also tired of being hungry and stressed in my own home. They don't think about me while they're eating my leftovers. AITA?",

      "body": "(**Note: I’m not involving the police, suing anyone, etc. Please don't try to argue with me about this or \"convince\" me why I should.**)\n\nI have a perfume collection that I started when I was a teenager slinging burritos as my first job. I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I’m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc. \n\nWhat I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn’t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her “private” Instagram wasn’t “friends only” or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had.\n\nI tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the “Tiktok famous” perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn’t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc. \n\nPetty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she’d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers.\n\nTheir argument is that now the money she was going to use for a car has to go towards paying me back. I don’t care. She is lucky that I have no interest in involving the police, small claims, or any of that. But AITA, because she IS a teenager?",

      "body": "My daughter turned 13 yesterday. I made sure to ask her what she wants for her birthday a few months in advance. She gave me a list. Great. I explained she won't be getting everything from the list as it was big and some things were expensive. She understood.\n\nAbout a week after we had that conversation, she tells me she wants tickets to a show for her birthday. Going to the show would also mean traveling a little out of the city. Neither are cheap. So I told her that would be the only gift she would get and would also replace a party. She said that's what she wants and I triple checked before I booked tickets.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, would you believe, she tells me she changed her mind again. She wants clothes instead of the show. I told her I already booked everything so there's absolutely no way. She got into a strop about it and said she isn't going. I told her fine I'll take someone else, fully expecting her to later apologize and say she is coming.\n\nBut the apology never came. In fact her attitude got worse and she got into trouble at school. She asked me if I got her the clothes and I told her no, I'm sticking to my word. I don't think she believed me. Well her birthday came and she realized I wasn't bluffing. I didn't get her any gifts. She was appalled and I was the worst mother ever. I told her she's learned a valuable lesson. I really wanted to make her birthday special but she was being awful. Of course other relatives got her things but none from me.\n\nShe told her grandparents her side of the story. Which was of course all one sided making her out as a victim. They called me and I explained to them the whole truth. They also think I'm awful and the \"poor girl\" needs gifts from her mother. I told them next year will be different if she behaves. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "body": "Okay so here’s the thing, I have this cousin who is a few years older than me. She came abroad and started living with me and my parents, studying for a course. The reason she started living with us was because her school was close to our house and at first I didn’t want this because we never really got along, but my parents let me know that I didn’t really have a choice in this matter. \n\nAnyways, As she started living with us I noticed her lifestyle was very different from mine. I would be working back to back shifts while she would be partying or resting in our guest room on her phone all day. I would come home from work at 9 PM and start cooking for myself (to save money) and she would ask me if she could have some of my dinner. And I know, I might sound selfish for saying this, but it bothered me so much. I would think, you were home all day and you didn’t even get up to make yourself dinner? \n\nI started wondering though how she could keep up her lifestyle, with student loans, and how lavish she was living. I mean she would go to expensive restaurants right across the street from my work and brag about it to me many many times, at least 3 or 4 times in a week. When they were restaurants I had never even been to because I could not afford to.\nOne day, I found out through a family member that it had been my grandparents giving her money this entire time. \n\nWhy you ask? Because she had been telling them that she had no money, and that she was “starving\", or needed money for \"school\" or \"basic expenses\" Basically she had been lying this entire time. And it bothered me so much because here are my grandparents, who believing that she is asking this money out of actually need, are giving it to her, and she is just living this lavish lifestyle. \n\nIt bothered me so much, because I was there working, and I never asked helped from my grandparents because I knew they didn’t have much to give. One time my grandpa had this injury but did not have enough money to get this cream for it and it broke my heart. And so to know that she was doing this to them made me angry. So I secretly took screenshots of her instas when she went out to these dinners over a few months and finally showed it to my grandparents that she wasn’t \"starving\" like she said. Or the fact that she was constantly partying. To show them what their money was going to, as she had no job. \n\nThey ended up cutting off a lot of her money that they were sending her, and she made it this big deal. She called me fake and said that I betrayed her. I honestly don’t have any regrets but I am still wondering, AITA? ",

      "body": "Its just getting really tiring. Anytime something makes her mad, she gets REALLY mad. Then she starts complaining about her blood pressure and how she feels ill and its all her kids fault because theyre awful and are causing her to have a 4th heart attack. \nAt this point it just sounds like shes reaching or she wants them to suck up to her, shes very manipulative to them. My bf is 24 and his brother is 31, she treats them like children and rules over them with an iron fist. He says its just a hispanic thing but dude come on..\n\nIf shes actually had 3 heart attacks due to \"high emotion\" and \"being unable to control her emotions\" then her heat must be fucked up. I can get one, but not more especially due to JUST stress. \nI keep telling him, if she thinks shes going to have a heart attack, she needs to call 911 and stop yelling at her kids and making her blood pressure fuckin burst.\n\n Im tired of her pushing them around saying she \"has chest pain\" and making them scared of upsetting her. Because god forbid you have a one to one about how you feel and she gets offensive and starts shouting, now its your fault shes having chest pain. For speaking up about how you feel about something. I get SO many texts about how \"moms mad\", \"you cant come over\", \"i cant talk on the phone right now\", \"i cant go out past 8pm\", \"i cant walk outside alone\", \"i cant go to the apt complex gym\", all this shit he cant do because itll \"make her mad\" and we \"cant make her mad\". Thats fucked up.\n\nSo i tell him all the time, listen. If shes had 3 heart attacks she needs to go to therapy and learn to control her anger. If yall dont believe in therapy she needs to speak to the older brother who left the family. She needs to be on an angina medication like nitroglycerin and stop using her unstable emotional state as a threat. \nUnderstandably, my fiancé gets a bit upset. Thats my mom, i dont want her to die of a heart attack. If i talk my mind shes gonna blow, etc. \n\nIm JUST saying. If shes going to have a heart attack. she needs to call 911. I dont want her to die, i know yall dont have money, but id rather go to the hospital than die and im sure she feels the same way. I am TIRED of her threatening her ADULT kids with her life to keep them under her.\n \nShe literally just said she cannot see his brothers boyfriend visually anymore because she will have a heart attack. What the fuck are you talking about.\n\n\nAITA for saying she is manipulating them and that they should not take her threat seriously when she is 61 years old and can handle her herself????? \nIve told him multiple times. \"I know you love her and dont want her to die but she is capable of calling 911 and im tired of hearing her threaten you all with that over the smallest shit\"\n\nEDIT: no one in the house likes when she does this. They do not like or respect her at all bc of that. They just deal with it because they cant leave due to finances. Theyre finally getting freedom end of this month and they are so relieved to finally get away from her. Both brothers are working on getting therapy and eager to be able to breathe and start life without her.\nSo no im not breaking up w my bf of 10 years. I just had to make sure im not an ass for telling him shes gonna be fine all the time. He worries for her health and loves her, but HATES how she uses it as a threat. I just had to make sure im telling him right. That he needs to ignore her threats.",

      "body": "My family just got back from a weeklong cruise, and there is still some tension about this. My wife and I took our 20yo son, 16yo daughter, 13yo son and 7yo son. Our oldest spent most of his time on vacation doing his own thing, having breakfast and dinner with the family but being seldom seen otherwise. My wife and I enjoyed spending time with out kids, but we also did some couple's activities.\n\nThere are clubs on the boat for kids, and our 13yo really enjoyed them, but our 7yo didn't and kept wanting to spend the day with his sister, who we'd given carte blanche to do her own thing as long as she ate with us and answered when we messaged her. She was a good sport and took her little brother on most of her adventures, swimming with him, taking him to trivia and doing the animation classes with him. I felt like this was very sweet of her and showed a great deal of maturity. The second to last day of the cruise I took her to the gift shop and told her to pick out whatever she wanted as thanks for looking after her brother.\n\nShe was very excited and ended up picking out a dress. The dress was $80. She wore it to dinner that night, and when she told her mom I bought it for her my wife gave me a weird look. After dinner she asked me why the hell I did that. I explained that it was a reward for looking after her brother. She said we can't buy an $80 dress for our daughter and nothing for our sons. I said we didn't get them nothing; we took them on a cruise.\n\nMy wife said I'm an idiot. I don't think so. We got some trinkets for the younger boys, about $20 worth of stuff. My wife thinks I fucked up and said I should apologize to the boys. I refuse. We took our adult son on a vacation that cost thousands of dollars, he has no reason to resent his sister being rewarded for being thoughtful. If we got our 7yo and 13yo a really expensive souvenir, it would probably be lost or broken. She still thinks I was an asshole though.\n\nClarification: A lot of commentors seem to think we asked our daughter to babysit her brother. That's not really the case. What kept happening was that she would tell us her plans for the day and 7yo would say he'd rather do that than go to the kid's club, and she would agree to let him come with her. So it was more just her being a nice sister than actual babysitting. She always had the ability to drop him off at the club. That's why I wanted to reward her, because I thought it was so sweet of her not to do that and to make her brother feel good about his cool older sister wanting to hang out with him.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my family if they don’t like the way something is, they can take care of it themselves?",
      "body": "I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. \n\nIn the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. \n\nI am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. \n\nThey’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. \n\nYesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. \n\nI had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. \n\nMy kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. \n\nBut afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. \n\nSo AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to help my wife's family anymore?",
      "body": "I (34m) got married 9 years ago to my wife Jessica (33f). Jessica and I have two children Robyn (7f) and Theo (5m). Growing up I didn't have a family. I was a foster kid who was bounced around a lot because sometimes my bio mother would take me back but she'd always end up losing custody again or placing me back. When she finally stopped trying I was 11 and too old for most people who wanted babies or really little kids. So I aged out of the system without being adopted or finding a family.\n\nI had hoped when Jessica and I met that I'd be welcomed by her family. But that's not how it went. Took me years to figure it out though. They look down on me. They're not totally obvious about it but I see it in the way they are with me vs the way they're with the other sons/daughters in law. Like asking them about Christmas plans but saying they didn't expect us to do anything else because I don't have a family. Or asking about the others jobs and promotions but never me, then acting so shocked both times Jessica or I mentioned I was promoted. There was a time when my SIL mentioned a foster kid who won a scholarship to college and it made it into the local news. The whole family's reaction was \"oh wow a foster kid making it to college is so unexpected\" and Jessica pointed out I went to college. They looked a little uncomfortable and I heard two of her siblings whisper something about \"Jessica and that story\" so I assume they believed she lied about where we met.\n\nThey don't make an effort for my birthday. They make assumptions that I don't spend time with my kids. They assume any effort made by me is me doing it for Jessica and don't believe me when I say it's not.\n\nYet they will always ask for my help with repairs around the house or assembling something, because I'm good at that stuff. I have helped Jessica's parents and all her siblings at least twice. Once I realized (with help from therapy) that they really didn't like me and seem to think less of me for being a foster kid, I did that stuff for Jessica and not for them. But then a few weeks ago Jessica's parents had issues with the stairs. I went and fixed them up. I was hours working on one part and had to go and get extra materials. It was a whole thing. Some of the family came over while I was there and Jessica's parents made food for them... but nothing for me. When I asked them if there was any for me they told me they didn't think I'd want to eat after working so hard... for hours... with no food in between. I told them they didn't think that, they simply didn't want to be polite to me and offer food after doing all that work for them. I was called out by Jessica's parents and her siblings. Jessica took my side as did some of the the siblings spouses. But I was called out again for not helping fix a shelf for one of Jessica's sisters and saying never again would I help any of them. They said family helps family. I asked them when they ever treat me like family.\n\nAITA?",

We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. \n\nLast week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). \n\nOn the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.\n\nHowever, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.\n\nI woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. \n\nI was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.\n\nWe both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. \n\nI reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. \n\nJustin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.\n\nI understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair. \n\nAITA?",

He insisted and even suggested I take the night off or swap shifts with another nurse but I couldn't do that last minute.\n\n\nI thought he dropped it then but when I went into the shower and got out I couldn't find him nor my car,  I freaked out and started calling for half an hour but he didn't answer me, I tried again til one of his friends picked up, I demanded he give the phone to my fiance but he said they were out and confirmed that he took my car and told me that my fiance said that it's better that I skip my shift and he'll be back with my car later. I couldn't take it I felt so enraged I had my fiance on the phone telling him I did not consent for him to take my car to go hang out with friends and said I'd call the police to get it back if he refused to come back with it, but he didn't take me seriously so I ended up calling the police and he and his friends were picked up at the bar where they were hanging out, then were taken to the police department.\n\nI got my car from there and still went to my shift, my fiance was let go hours after I left and he blew up my phone with missed calls and texts about how I was out of my mind to call the police on him and put him in this situation. I did not respond but when I got off work the next day we got into an argument and he said he couldn't believe I'd do this to him but I told him he made me do this to which he responded that I was petty and callous because not only did I ruin his new years celebration, but all his friends aren't speaking to him after I put them in this situation as well and he then kept giving me silence about it.\n\nI did consider this a form of theft especially since he went behind my back after getting a \"NO\" from me, but he was shocked that I'd even imply that he was a thief and said what's yours is mine and vice versa so I shouldn't be using the terms \"theft and stealing\".",

      "title": "AITA for telling my pregnant friend I can’t stand her complaining anymore? ",
      "body": "I want to start off by saying that I (F29) am 7 months pregnant myself. My friend Cassie (25F) is also pregnant, and about 7 weeks ahead of me. \n\nAt first it was awesome being pregnant together— we’d vent about things, talk about how excited we are, plan mommy-to-be dates, etc. But now her attitude has been rubbing me the wrong way and I can’t stand talking to her about it anymore. \n\nShe’s gone from occasional venting to texting me upwards of 5 times a day about every horrible symptom she has. What bothers me is that I also have a lot of the same irritating pregnancy symptoms, but when I try to sympathize she pulls the “oh just WAIT until you’re at _____ weeks!” card as if it’s some strange competition. \n\nSo I dropped the sympathy angle and decided to just send her positive messages instead. But she totally sidesteps my attempts at positivity or my suggestions and complains about something else. For example, if I suggested a medicine I took for heartburn she’d reply “no I’ll just throw it up.” If I tried to suggest that she take some time off work because she’s clearly unhappy, she’d reply “I can’t I don’t have enough sick days.” Which is fair, I guess, but it gets old very quick being shot down over and over. She ignores all my upbeat messages about staying strong and that she’s almost there and that she can do it and replies with “I’m miserable” instead. \n\nWhat pushed me over the edge is she also stopped asking me about my pregnancy completely. Never checks in with me, never asks about my baby, and when I try to share anything positive she hardly acknowledges it. I went from feeling like we were in this together to feeling like she is the only pregnant one. I finally snapped when she texted me about her swollen ankles for the 20th time and said that I’m already anxious enough with my own due date creeping up and that her negativity is ruining my own pregnancy. I told her that I’m not feeling great either, but I’m not sending her lists of ailments every morning and I suggested she start venting to her husband instead. \n\nI obviously hurt her feelings— she read it and hasn’t spoken to me since. I feel completely justified, but my husband said I shouldn’t have said anything, that she’s “clearly struggling more”, and that I should just basically treat her with pity because she’s so unhappy. I think she’s a total downer and I don’t need that energy weighing me down, but now I’m wondering if I’m being insensitive because she is so close to giving birth and clearly having more complications than I am. \n\nAITA?

      "title": "AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid?",
      "body": "So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.\n\nI'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to \"Bob\" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.\n\nNow after I moved out, she started complaining how \"She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!\" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.\n\nAnyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: \"I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.\"\n\nI was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.\n\nMy sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.\n\nSo AITA here?\n\nEdit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. ",

      "title": "AITA for shaking my leg during a musical?",
      "body": "I'm a 15 F who goes to an international school in Korea. Now, I lived in the USA for a big part of my life so I do get a lot of people confused when I say I'm 100% Korean. Most people here think I can't speak Korean or that I'm a foreign person. Neither are true. I usually don't get offended when people assume or speak to me in English automatically but today was different. I've had a rough day and I really wanted to get my mind off things watching the musical \"Wicked\". It was the thing I was most excited about all month. The first act was going amazing but somewhere through it I started to shake my leg. I have a bad habit of fidgeting and I either shake my leg, fidget with my hair/fingers, or just try to move around. I don't notice when I'm doing it and I've been trying to fix it but oh well, today was just not the day I guess. \n\nSo about 30 seconds go by and the lady next to me pokes me in the arm. I turn to her and she just glares at me without saying anything, that's when I notice I'm shaking my leg and probably disturbing her. I immediately stop and apologize quietly. I think nothing of it and I finish the rest of Act 1 without shaking my leg. During intermission I had one airpod in listening to some music when I heard the lady next to me talking to her (assumed) teen daughter. She was talking about how I'm probably stupid and that I was disturbing the whole row by shaking my leg for the majority of Act 1 (She was talking in Korean btw). I heard this and I had to double check because there's no way that she's saying all this when I'm sitting right next to her. I then hear her say \"Oh it's okay I don't think she understands Korean. She looks like a foreigner.\" She then went on to talk about me for the rest of intermission. \n\nThis whole thing ruined the rest of the experience for me. I was too scared to confront her because she looks around triple my age. After the show, my mother picked me up and I told her what went down because I was truly hurt by what the lady said. My mother then said that this wouldn't have happened if I wasn't shaking my leg and that it was basic theatre etiquette. I felt very betrayed and hurt by this because this was just the cherry on top of the cake for a shitty day. I didn't talk for the rest of the car ride and I was pretty moody. When we got home my mom scolded me again for saying that I should have enjoyed the experience instead of sulking because it was expensive to acquire the tickets. We are now arguing and not talking. It's only been like 2 hours since this all occured but now I'm wondering if I was overemotional and that this whole thing was my fault. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not telling a vegan mom that the candy she stole from my kids and was eating, wasn’t vegan?",
      "body": "This happened on Halloween and the day following.\nMy neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. \n\nMy apartment complex didn’t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.\n\nResidents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional “knock on door, physically hand strangers candy” was not permitted.\n\nSo, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn’t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.\n\nThe next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded “nope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night” \nI was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.\n\nShe said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a “tax.”\n\nHer son then chimes in and said “you only took two bags from us!” \nshe responded with “but I’m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax” \n\nI was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said “hey, aren’t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. “\n\nI explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.\n\nShe was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. \n\nNow she’s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won’t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.\n\nMy husband thinks I’m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. \n\nI don’t think it’s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn’t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.\n\nEdit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn’t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. \n\nAs for the authenticity of her vegansim- \nI may have exaggerated when I said “super vegan” when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it’s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan “lifestyle” if that makes sense. \n\nNow for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it’s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can’t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.\n\nI think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can’t be vegan and not know these things. I’m not vegan, I’m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. \n\nAbout the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)\n\nEDIT #2 \nI cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren’t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn’t have told me what was actually wrong. \nTurns out he was calling me an asshole cause she’s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven’t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I’m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn’t stop. \n\nI also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my roommate to stop propagating more plants because the apartment no longer feels shared?",
      "body": "I live in a three-bedroom apartment with two roommates. We just re-signed our lease for another year, partly because the market is competitive and partly because we all like the place. Over the past year, we’ve experienced minor tensions when it comes to cleaning standards, but nothing major.\n\nOne ongoing issue has been how changes to the common space are handled. My belongings have been rearranged or replaced multiple times without notice, such as when a baker’s table I liked was removed and replaced with a shelf. I’ve tried to be flexible and not make a fuss.\n\nBut one roommate’s plant collection has slowly taken over the living space. She started with about five or six plants in the living room, but now there are over twenty. Every table, shelf, and windowsill is packed. She’s even hanging plants from the closet doorknobs. They’re mostly propagations of the same two species, and the quantity has made it feel like there’s no room left for anyone else. I can’t even use the coffee table or watch TV without having to move plants.\n\nIt’s also affecting how the apartment functions. She repots plants frequently, and dirt ends up on surfaces and windowsills, which she doesn't try to clean thoroughly after. One sill is so coated that my attempts at cleaning it haven’t helped, and I’m worried we’ll be charged for it. She’s also moved some of my plants, including one in a sentimental pot I’d previously said was important, to areas without sun. She insists we leave the blinds open at all times and says I can’t open the windows because it would damage her plants.\n\nI finally snapped and told her we needed to stop adding more plants and actually talk about how we use the shared space. She was upset and said she just wanted the apartment to feel lived-in. I said I understood that, but it doesn’t feel like our apartment anymore; it feels like *hers*.\n\nShe responded that the space hadn’t really been decorated before, and I told her I’d be happy to help make it feel more like home, but I want to do that collaboratively and blend our styles. It’s not that our tastes are different; it’s that I haven’t been included in any of the decisions. I wasn’t trying to be mean, and I get that plants bring her joy. However, I feel that there has been no real collaboration, and I’m constantly expected to adapt without any room for compromise.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDIT / INFO:**\n\n* My roommate already has about 20 plants in her bedroom. She has the largest room in the apartment, and it gets a lot of light because of a south-facing window. The living space also has south-facing windows, so it gets a ton of sun during the day and honestly feels like a greenhouse at midday.\n* My bedroom has a north-facing alley window, so there’s very little natural light. That’s why my sentimental plant pot is in the living space. It needs sun, and the living room is the only real option for it.\n* There are also plants in the kitchen. Her process involves propagating the plants on the kitchen windowsill and then moving them into the living room once they have rooted. So it’s not just the living room, that's their final destination.\n* We now have sticky gnat traps in nearly every plant. I know gnats are common with houseplants and I have dealt with them myself, but the sheer number doesn't help.\n* The baker’s rack I mentioned wasn’t thrown away. It’s currently sitting in one of our closets, which takes up a good chunk of our storage space.\n* Our third roommate has stayed out of this. She mostly keeps to herself and prefers to spend time in the kitchen, which is less impacted by the plants. She hasn’t really weighed in and seems to be steering clear of the whole situation.\n* The current conversation actually started when she went on vacation for a week. She left a sticky note on her door asking me to open and close it at certain times so her plants could get proper airflow. It wasn’t a huge ask, and I made sure her plants got airflow like she requested. But it made me realize just how many accommodations I’ve been making, and that’s when I brought up that we probably need to have a broader conversation about how we use shared space.\n* In terms of where things stand now, I asked her to remove or relocate some of the plants and to stop propagating or repotting in shared spaces. She said I was interfering with her hobby and what brings her joy. So we haven’t resolved anything yet.",

      "body": "My nephews both graduated from high school this morning and I wanted to sit up front so I camped out a bit in front of the entrance. I brought my folding camping chair and my headphones to listen to my show.\n\nAbout 40 minutes before the school would let us inside, a pregnant woman got next to me since somebody let her in line (I assume her partner). She asked me within 5 minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time. I said no, sorry I need it more (bad feet/knees) and went back to my things. She asked me again within 2 minutes and the answer was the same. She however got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me. He asked me himself (politely) and I again responded that sorry but I need it more and suggested she could wait in their car or just sit in the ground. At this point the husband directly called me an asshole but left me alone\n\nAita",

      "title": "AITA for telling my sister she’s a shitty mother in the family group chat?",
      "body": "My sister “Sara” (35) and I (30F) see each other around Christmas every year, other than that we don’t really communicate except for the occasional family group chat exchange. She has 2 sons, Jackson (15) and Ethan (13). I’ve always known that Ethan is quiet and reserved, and until recently I thought he preferred to not have a lot of attention, until I realized he’s just not getting any.\n\nUntil last Christmas, I thought Jackson and Ethan had the same dad. I learned Jackson’s dad left Sara after she cheated on him, hence, Ethan. I recently realized that Sara would reach out in the chat on behalf of Jackson. If he had a sports game, doing a fundraiser, had a social event to attend, she would ask us to attend, donate, or help him get to/from his social event if she couldn’t take him. Or if he was suspended from school, she would reach out to us for help, but RARELY would we hear anything about Ethan, and she NEVER told us that Jackson was suspended 99% of the time for bullying Ethan and his friends. They now go to separate schools!\n\nRecently Sara asked if someone could take Ethan to his school choir concert so she could attend parent conferences at Jackson’s school. Odd to me because she didn’t ask anyone to go watch him perform, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe Ethan didn’t want anyone to watch. I offered to take him, watch the concert if he wanted me to, and take him home. He had a solo, he was smiling and clearly loved what he was doing. His choir director said Ethan is always helping other students and asked me to come to more concerts. \n\nSome time after, Sara was once again busy at Driver's Ed with Jackson and Ethan was home. He started vomiting and called his mom. She reached out and asked if anyone else could go take care of him until she got home, so I did. But she didn’t come home early. Two weeks later (two weeks ago from now) he broke his hand.\n\nLast weekend I bought tickets to the symphony and planned to take him, but wound up not being able to because I was sick. I transferred the tickets to his mom and begged her to take him and she said she would. I texted Ethan yesterday and asked how he liked it but he didn’t respond. So I called his mom.\n\nShe didn’t take him and didn’t find anyone else to. She was “busy” and forgot, but wasn't too busy to ask the family group chat THE DAY OF THE CONCERT if anyone would help pay for Jackson's DC trip in the spring. I went off on her in the family group chat and said she is being a shitty mother. I said I don’t know if it’s because she inherited the favoritism gene from our parents or if she is subconsciously punishing him because SHE cheated and got rightfully dumped, and I told her that she needs to step up for her son.\n\nOf course this has caused a group chat storm. At first I felt justified, but some of the responses say otherwise, and Sara of course says I'm the biggest AH. AITA for calling her out in front of the rest of the family?",

Of course, it’s a privilege to photograph these special moments for my sister and future brother-in-law. However, she’s now asked me to be the photographer at the upcoming wedding. Once again, it’s an honour to be asked, but I declined and said I’d rather attend as a guest and actually enjoy the day instead of viewing it all through a camera.\n\nShe didn’t take that too well and has caused a massive drama over it. I’ve had family and friends texting me asking why I won’t do it, and my parents insisting I should because it’s not about me. I felt it was a perfectly reasonable decision to decline, but after so many people disagreeing with me, I’m not so sure anymore\n\n",

You see a momth before the trip, she went to my room without permission. She had a call. She claimed she went to my room because the signal was stronger. I got mad and told her to apologize but she goes “Im in the workforce, you are not. You dont know whats a life or death situation”. So I left my friend’s birthday gift in her room. Inwent in the got it then when I exited she was outside and saw me exit the room.\n\n\nShe got mad at why Im in her room without her permission but I told her she did the same thing but again she goes “Work can be life or death. Your friend’s Trader Joe’s is not”. I called her a hypocritical b*tch and she got so mad. We argued then I told her I have to go let’s forget this ever happened.\n\nOkay so Inrealized I did not have to call her a b word. When Inapologized about using the b word she asked me “are you gonna apologize for enterring my room”? I told her “not unless you apologize also for doing the same thing”. She just told me “You will never know what life or death is until you start your first day of work on monday”. I told her whatever and let’s move on. I only have to applogize for the b word.

      "title": "AITA for turning off the tumbler dryer and making my housemate go to work with wet clothes?",
      "body": "I 21F am in a bit of an argument with my housemate right now and I'm wondering if I'm justified here. For context, I have a chronic illness which causes chronic fatigue. If I don't get enough sleep I feel very unwell, and it makes my pain and other symptoms much worse as well as just being horribly tired all day. I try not to use earplugs as for reasons I won't get into they cause my ears to get blocked and very painful quite easily. \n\nI live in a student house on the bottom floor (I can't manage stairs so it was the only option for me) across the hall from the tumble dryer. The dryer is Loud. It rattles the floor and beeps when it's done until someone (usually me) opens the door or turns it off. It keeps me awake and if someone puts it on while I'm asleep it's guaranteed to wake me up. Given my condition and just generally needing to not have my sleep interrupted I asked my housemates not to turn it on after 11pm. We all agreed to this arrangement and there were no problems. \n\nRecently one of my housemates has been consistently using the tumble dryer late at night. I spoke to him and said if he keeps doing it I will just turn it off after 11pm, regardless of if his clothes are dry. This is where I might be the asshole. He put clothes in the dryer at about 2 in the morning and woke me up. I was pissed off and turned the dryer off so I could sleep. When I woke up he had sent me a message saying that because of me he had to go to work with wet, musty smelling clothes. He had only put the dryer on that late at night because he had no other option and couldn't I have just put up with it for one night. \n\nHe has done this 3 or 4 times and I didnt complain so maybe he thought I didnt mind that much? I probably should have spoken to him before I got fed up and just turned it off, but I did warn him that I would turn the dryer off if he did it again. I do feel bad that he had to go to work with damp clothes though. I really don't feel like it was that bad of a thing to do but he is quite upset with me and wants me to apologise. AITA?\n\nEDIT for clarity and because I seem to not have explained somethings very well\n- We do not live in an American style dorm / student accommodation where there are rules set out by the owner of the complex and you do not choose your housemates. We are privately renting and a group of friends who have known each other before choosing to move in with each other \n- We all agreed on the rules before moving in together. The 11pm time is a general rule for being quiet across the house \n- He dried his clothes that late because he was coming in from the club and had forgotten he had work the next day\n- He has asked us (all housemates) not to use the shower past 11pm for similar reasons (it wakes him up). We all agreed to this and stick to this rule \n- The dryer sucks and we have spoken to the landlord but he also sucks so nothing has been done about it yet. ",

      "body": "For starters, I want to preface that I’m aware not everyone knows the intricacies of asexuality and all that goes with it, so that isnt what I am frustrated about.\n\nI am asexual, and have known this for a few years. Most of my friends who I am quite close with are aware of this, but I haven’t told all that many people. This tends to be more from a I just don’t want to bring it up and make the conversation awkward but if its brought up by someone else I have no problem talking about it.\n\nSo, a few days ago I was speaking to my friend who is (as far as I’m aware) a straight, allosexual, cis male with very limited exposure to queerness in real life, as we both attended a fairly conservative, catholic all boys school, although our sex ed class did include a brief mention of various sexualities including asexuality. We were discussing his dating profile on an app when he asked if I had the app. I said no, and that I wasn’t interested in dating at the moment. When he asked why I told him that I’m asexual. He gave me a confused and concerned look for about 10 seconds in silence and then asked me with an unreasonable amount of sincerity “Like, you’re a plant?”. I was honestly taken aback by this response, and thought maybe he was joking so I replied laughing “Do I look like a fucking plant?” (I’m an Aussie so casual swearing is very common). He looked really upset with me and stopped speaking for a bit and then made an excuse to leave.\n\nLater, he texted me saying that he thought I was rude to him because he shouldn’t be expected to know “all this weird stuff” and thag I “ruined an important moment for [him]” (I don’t really understand that second message tbh).\n\nI’m completely of the mindset that coming out to someone means I will have to explain some aspects of asexuality to him, but AITA for thinking that asking if I’m a plant was a stupid question?",

      "body": "I F, 34 have been with my fiance M, 37 for 3 years. Getting married before the end of this year and recently moved in the house that I inherited from my mom. The house is in my name and it took a lot of talking and convincing from him to have his name on the title as well. Now honestly part of me doesn't think this is a good idea, at least not right now maybe after marriage? But anyway, I've decided to go ahead and put his name on the title so he could go ahead and start contributing towards mortgage more and light my burden a little bit. \n\nWe've made appointments, decided on which form of ownership we were basing this on. when it was time for me to sign the deed, My fiance stopped me and gave me a pen saying this pen was his \"lucky\" pen and told me to use it to sign the deed. I took it and tried to sign but turned out it was empty. He was like \"oh I must've forgotten\" while laughing and then pulled out his \"other lucky pen\". I took it, tried to sign and that one too was empty. Honestly, seeing how he was laughing I figured he was messing with me but he swore he wasn't and pulled out ANOTHER one of his lucky pens. I tried that one too and it was empty. my fiance started cackling and I felt humiliated especially with how the gentleman next to him was staring. I got pissed and asked him what that was about and he said it was a prank. I asked \"really? Did you really think this was a time for pranks?\" He was like \"it's alright you can use \"a real pen\" now\". I pushed the paper away and said \"you know what? Never mind because I no longer want you on the deed\". He lost it completely saying we had a deal and I can't back out of it just like that, and that it was a stupid joke that I took too seriously. We had an argument and I refused to sign the deed at least not then and there. \n\nAt home he blew up again saying I was the one who \"delayed the process\" and that he already gave me a real pen and all I had to do was sign the \"damn paper\" and get it over with. He accused me of looking for an excuse not to have him on the deed and started the silent treatment saying there's nothing to say til those papers are signed.\n\nDid I really take this too seriously?",

He went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off. The next day she went home and told the family who berated me calling my behavior towards MIL abhorrent and loathsome, now my husband is complaining about how I keep trying to ruin his relationship with his family and push them away. \n\nBut I want to know if I was really ta?",

The other three have kids, this post is about A(35F) and B(32F), A have 4 kids (17F, 15M, 14M, 9F), the younger 3 have severe physical and mental disabilities. B have 3 (12M, 7M, 2F), the oldest and middle have the same disabilities as my older sister's children, and the younger have down syndrome. They are both SAHM, all the children are in the disability programs my country offers but there is not much money left, after all the medical bills of therapy and meds they need. Their husband's have ok jobs, but with the severity of the children's disabilities it is hard to go by. \n\nOn the other hand, I am single, child-free by choice, went to university, totally debt free, have a masters, and work from home in my dream field. Last month I bought my first house.\n\nI invited my family and friends for a house warming this Saturday. I paid for two caretakers to care for their children so they could come. Everything was fine and fun. Until the end of the night, my friends had already gone home, and it was the three of us. They started to talk about me setting down, marrying, and having kids, since I bought a house. I remembered that I didn't want kids. This talk circulated several times. Until they asked me why foi the tenth time. I told them, besides really not wanting to have a child, I love my freedom, I love the life that I already have. Thinking about our family DNA, that is a high chance of having a disabled child, that means more work and sacrificing, I don't want to sacrifice myself. I want to have money for hobbies, to take care of myself, for expensive clothes and hairdressers, to travel, to live and not just survive. I love them, they're great mom's but I don't want to make the sacrifices to be the same, I would be an awful and spiteful mom, and no one deserves that.\n\nFrom everything I said, the only thing they listened to was about not wanting a disabled child. They went on a spiral about how much of a blessing their kids are, how I am an egotistical bitch, and so much more. They blocked me on social media, and aren't answering me in the family group chat. My mom called to give me a speech about how my disabled brother (36M)was a blessing in her life, how he is a gift from God, and uninvited me from christmas because my sisters won't come if I come. I called my brother (39), his two children are adopted. He admitted a long time ago this was due to the high chance of disability in our family. He told me my delivery is rude, but they also suck, they should know not everyone wants kids. He encouraged me to apologize because I know how they are. \n",

      "title": "AITA for dropping out of my friends wedding the day before?",
      "body": "My best friend (29F) recently got married. I (30F) have been her bridesmaid for about a year now, partaking in bridesmaids duties. Her and I have been close friends for several years. During our friendship, I moved to the other side of the country and am now a 6 hour flight away with a three hour time difference. \n\n\nHer wedding took place on a Saturday. On Thursday, my cat, started acting strange but I didn’t think much of it. On Friday, I decided I had to take my cat to the vet. The vet said she had a kidney infection and that it was serious and that my cat would need to be hospitalized. I was terrified that she would die. \n\n\nAfter going back and forth with myself (and my fiance) for hours, I made the truly difficult decision to call my friend on Friday and tell her I can’t make it to the wedding. When I told my friend, she said I should take care of my cat. I asked her if she was mad and she said “I don’t know how to feel.” I love my friend, but I needed to stay here to be with her. It’s heart wrenching to think about my cat needing me and me being too far away to come. I’m all she has. \n\n\nOf course I felt incredibly guilty missing the wedding and I still feel awful about the decision. I didn’t make the decision lightly. \n\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, I sent her a text saying I hope the wedding goes well and that I’m happy she’s marrying her partner. She said “ok thanks”. I haven’t reached out since because I wanted to give her space and have her come to me. \n\n\nTwo weeks have gone by, and she texted me this morning (a little heated). She asked me how my cat was and I said she’s ok. She was hospitalized for a few days and is now at home. She told me that she disagreed with my decision. I told her that I’m so sorry and feel awful about missing the wedding. I told her I love her and continuously apologized. She asked me if I regret my decision and I said no. \n\n\nShe asked me why my fiance couldn’t handle it and I told her that it’s ultimately my cat and I want to be nearby if anything were to take a turn for the worse. \n\n\nOne of the other bridesmaids texted me the morning of the wedding (8am) asking me if I could take a later flight and miss the wedding but come to the reception (which started at 6pm). I said it was too late. Again, I’m 6 hours away with a 3 hour time change. I don’t know if there was a direct flight that would’ve gotten me in on time. \n\n\nMy friend told me that people “volunteered” to her they would not have made the same decision as me and that what I did was “fucked up”. I didn’t know my cat would be OK until Saturday at 11am. At that point, it was too late. Again, I could not leave my cat if she needed me. I would never expect anyone in my life to abandon their animal.  \n\n\nSo, I was surprised when she said she wouldn’t have made the same decision as me. That she would have left her dog to be at my wedding if the roles were reversed. So Reddit - am I the asshole?\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "So me (24M) and my friend (24M) were playing a game online and I was trying to communicate with him in a group discord call at the same time. When I tried to coordinate something with him in the game, he said he couldn’t talk to me and play the game at the same time, as he could only focus on one thing. I made a joke about how it would be a shame if his future wife was well endowed and that he would only be able to focus on one breast. Everyone in the discord call laughed, but the friend got mad at me and quit playing with us. I understand that it’s a sexist joke, but most jokes we told each other have had a sexual nature at one point or another. \nNo women were in the call, otherwise I wouldn’t have said anything inappropriate. Me and this friend have had a laugh before about his fetishes, so I thought this would be okay.\nHe joined the call later and acted like nothing happened. I didn’t ask him why exactly was he mad about what I said, and I just continued playing.\n\nMy friend isn’t dating anyone, nor am I if that matters. He has never been married before either.\nSo AITA here? \n",

      "title": "AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?",
      "body": "My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \"fun\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \"acceptable\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.\n\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \"green\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \"cheese\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.\n\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \"unethical\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\n\n**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.\n\n**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",

      "body": "Im a 34 yr old M married to the love of my life a 33 yr old F. My wife is kind, nurturing, and motivated in her career. She does a lot for me at home since i work LONG hours. We married 4 months ago. Dated for 8 yrs.We're both easy going and have the same sense of humor and rarely argue. \n\nI make 4x more money(I'm in Healthcare) but she makes a good salary as well. Since I make 4x what she does I tend to pay for most things(dinners, weekend trips, mall shopping) which I absolutely do not mind. With bigger purchases we pay for things together in proportion to what we make. she's usually OK with paying her share of things (1/4 of the rent and groceries) and will sometimes offer to pay for dinners and dates.\n\nShe's VERY close with her best friends (she has 4).They're great people, But theyre basically attached to the hip and talk daily in a group chat. Which is fine, everyone needs a support system. I have similar friends. \n\nHer and her 4 friends have a combined savings account together for \"investing in something together\". They've each been putting in a few hundred dollars per month EACH. I've known about this for years and didn't love the idea initially, which I expressed. But she was adamant she wanted this and at the time we weren't hurting for the money and it was ultimately her money and her decision. \n\nWe are now looking to buy a home (in one of the most expensive real-estate markets in the US) she expresses that she doesn't have much in her own savings but has 20k of her own money tied in with her friends combined savings. \n\nOver the last year they've been told by 2 financial advisors that 5 people attempting to invest together in real-estate or stocks or a business wasnt a great idea. And they also recommended to split the funds to 5 separate accounts since the account is under 1 of the friend's names and there are tax implications for having that amount of money to her name (100k). The homes we're looking at need around 60-70k for a down payment. I stated I was willing to spend nearly all my savings for the down payment for a home (50k). So I told her she should pull that money from her joint friends account to help with the down payment. It's a huge purchase and I don't think it should be my burden alone. She got really upset and told me \"I don't want to touch that money, I promised my friends it would be for investing together, we should look for a less expensive home then, maybe a fixer upper\" she then stated, \"it would be easier for you to accrue the money back since you make so much more.\"\n\nThis was VERY frustrating and I told her, \"its unfair i have to spend nearly all my savings and you dont. your friend fund is stupid, and it's stupid not to use that money for OUR future home.\"\n\nAITA for asking her to use HER OWN cash from her \"friends\" account, break that promise to her friends so we can buy a nice home together?

We used to be very very close and her death, coupled with the loss of my child devastated me. I slipped into depression, developed anorexia and lost a huge amount of weight in a very short time. I used to be 165 pounds and now I'm at 120 pounds. \n\nI attended my best friend's wedding yesterday (tiny ceremony). It was the first social event I attended this year after my \"transformation\". \n\nThere was an acquaintance there who seemed enthralled by my body. She's very into fitness but she's not someone I am particularly close and she kept asking me about diet plans and said that she needed to know my \"secret workout routine\" for her clients. I politely deflected the questions at first and said something along the lines of \"I just was not in a good place, lost my appetite and it just happened\". But she kept pestering me and said I should help other people lose weight too. \n\nI lost my patience and told her that \"I actually developed an eating disorder and severe depression. I don't think your clients would like this routine\". She made a face and left me alone for the day. I thought this would be the end of it.\n\nTurns out, after the celebrations were over, she went and complained to my best friend's husband (she's his sister) and he called me and asked me to apologise for \"embarrassing his sister on his wedding\". I've refused to apologise as of now and I'm not sure if I should.\n\nAITA for telling an acquaintance that my workout routine was depression?",

      "body": "Context, it was a four way intersection with traffic lights and there was a car being loaded onto a flatbed at one of the corners. Cars were pulling up and stopping in all lanes regardless if the traffic lights were green. The Police officer was in his high visibility green vest standing in the middle of the intersection and was visibly irritated, cars were stopping and he would sort of point left or right. When I say sort of he barely raised his arm above his waist. Also there were two officers in a squad car parked in a turning lane just talking from what I could tell.  \n\nAs I pulled up I wasn't sure if I should follow the traffic signals or wait for the officer as he just turned and faced the flatbed truck. Our lane and the opposing lane were just stopped there when the light turned green, eventually right before the like turned yellow someone in the opposite lane just went. \n\nAt this point I was very upset, after waving at the cop he turned towards me and points in both directions (left and right) and made a face like (what, what do you want).\n\n I rolled down my window and yelled \"can I go?! What are you doing?!\"\n\nHis response was \"is the light green?\" (It wasn't)\n\nThen I said \"we don't know what's going on you should be the one directing traffic, do your F****** job\" \n\nHe mumbled something and turned back towards the truck. \n\nAt this point we understand when the light turns green we could turn. And so we did and went about our day. \n\nI mean, in hindsight I should have realized he was giving people simple  directions to turn because they couldnt go straight down that one particular lane, but when he stands there waving his arms you immediately assume he's controlling traffic but when he's barely raising his arms above his waste and turns his attention to the flatbed like he wasn't just waving at cars really had me confused in the moment.

      "body": "I'm (25m) engaged to Ash (25f) and recently we had an incident with my family where I put my foot down with my family and they think I'm TA. So we were all having dinner, mom and dad, half siblings (mom's kids with her ex-husband) and their spouses, full siblings, and me and Ash. During dinner my parents asked Ash if she'd heard from her siblings recently and Ash said no and she wouldn't expect to ever hear from them. \n\nAsh was raised with half siblings who were older than her but did not like that she existed and made sure she knew she was less than in their eyes for being half. They chose no contact once they turned 18 and cut off their (shared) dad too. Ash carries some sadness around because of it. She's an only child otherwise and still loves them and sometimes struggled with the little girl inside of her who really looked up to them. But she's working with a therapist to make sure she's doing better mentally. Especially now that she's an adult who has accepted she'll never have a relationship with them.\n\nMy siblings brought up that they find the half thing weird and we never used it and nobody they know would ever personally use it. Mom said it's not something that should be encouraged and she'll never understand anyone dividing family up that way.\n\nMy half siblings said they just don't want to think people use it, but they do all of the time. They said they always used it for us. That most of us just closed our ears off to it and liked to pretend we're all full siblings. They said we're not and the relationship they have with the rest of us will always be less than the one they have with each other because they have an entirely different side of their family to us and a different dad to us and we only think it's the same because we never went through divorce and/or death of a parent. They went through both. My half siblings went onto say their kids know we're not their real aunts and uncles and that our dad isn't their real grandpa. And it's dumb to think step and half are ignored.\n\nMy half siblings left and the rest of my family tried blaming Ash because she brought it up (my parents did, not Ash) and look what she started kind of thing. My mom said that kind of talk was never in our house before. I told them to stop and when they tried to say Ash working on accepting \"half is less\" (which she's not working to accept that but to accept her half siblings not wanting anything to do with her) I suggested to Ash that we leave and told my family that I was not going to tolerate that from them. I told them it was inappropriate and we would not come back if they were going to keep blaming Ash for something she had no role in.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "I (31M) have been with my wife (30F) for 10 years now and she always has had this habit of making me look bad with our finances. Whenever anything regarding spending money comes up she will always say how broke we are and she doesn't have the money to do this or buy that. The thing is we are doing well financially. We have decent jobs and combine our salary is roughly $125k/yr.\n\nAs of today our net worth is more than $1 million but less than 2. I had saved/invested a lot before getting married so I gave us a good head start. I control the finances/take the lead but we both agreed to living a very modest life. We both have our cars from college for example (Honda & Toyota). She knows everything about our finances because at least once a month I go over it with her every time I deposit money in our investment accounts or our kids college funds. For banking we have an emergency fund and I budget everything else to go straight into investments. We basically stay right at $10k in our banks savings account and $500 in our checking account after bills. EDIT: Most of the time there is more than $500 in our checkings but once I pay our CC each month I then move anything extra. We always use the CC so its not like we only have $500 to spend. Our CC limit is $25,000.\n\nA few months ago we had dinner with her friends and they talked buying a new car. My wife said something like, 'I wish I could get a new car but I'm always broke after paying the bills. We still have our college cars!' (EDIT: Wife does not want a new car). She will go on to talk about if she had money what she would want to buy and it always makes me feel ashamed. This 'I'm broke story' has been happening for years. When we were driving home I asked her about. She understood we have the money but its how she feels because her bank account is always low. I said I can increase our budget or keep more money in our bank if she wants. Since we are doing well I'm okay with spending more. She said no and again was happy with our finances. I explained that when she says we are broke it makes me look bad and I feel ashamed. Its as though I can't provide for the family and/or I am bad with money. She doesn't see it that way. \n\nThe same conversation has come up numerous times about us being broke. Recently, I reminded her numerous tikes it makes me feel and look bad infront of friends and family. I told her if she keeps saying stuff like that I will reveal that we are doing well with money. I gave her a few reminders I'd eventually do this but she kept going with the I'm broke story.\n\nAt a dinner with her sister and parents the same I'm broke story came up. I piped in and said, 'It's weird to hear a millionaire say they are broke.' My wife said, 'Haha, I'm not though.' And I quickly say, 'We are millionaires and you know that. We go over our finances every month.' Well the I'm broke story stopped after that and the night went on as usual. A little later the same thing happens with her friends and I use the same line. \n\nNow my wife is mad at me for using that line and revealing roughly how much money we have. She said it seems like I'm gloating. I say its better than making me look like I'm running us into the ground fincially. So AITA for revealing our networth when my wife says we are broke?\n\nEDIT: Final update for now as we have a long weekend planned. Some key points I saw a lot of and wanted to give answers.\n\n-I'm pretty open to us spending money and I don't restrict her spending. She has the CC to spend money monthly. Most of the month we have far more than $500 in our checking but I move anything above to our investments once I pay the CC every month. I know I won't have any big expenses then. If I do we have the CC limit and the $10k emergency cash.\n\n-We live on a really cheap area and had a low cost of living. We never felt rhe need to upgrade ungrade until we wanted to start having kids. I didn't have to change our lifestyle much to save a lot. \n\n-My job is in demand and pays well because nobody wants to live out in my area. So after expenses I take home a lot more than I would living in a major city. Probably 3 to 4 times more net savings annually if I had to guess.\n\n-She doesn't want a new car and has told me that multiple times. She doesn't like driving and feels comfortable with her current car. \n\n-She doesn't know what she wants to do when she retires. I know I'll be golfing, games, and eating edibles most days. I don't do any of this much now because we have kids and they will be my focus for a long time. I maybe golf 1 or 2 times a month amd thats the only times I take edibles.\n\n-I'll speak more with my wife about this. After reading posts I think she may not feel like its her money since she never saved much before we got engaged.",

      "body": "UPDATE: i locked the front door and packed all his stuff. My bf is at work rn so i’m alone in this. I just messaged him that his stuff is ready to go and he needs to leave. I called his job and he didn’t even go to work today, AGAIN. I’d be lying if i said this was my last straw because i’ve been done with his cr*p for a while now. Thanks everyone for the support and love! Now i can finally live in peace again. \n\n\n\n\nHello Redditors, As the title suggests, i’m kicking my boyfriends brother out today. For context, I, 22F, and my boyfriend, 24M, have been together for 4 years. We have lived together for 3. My boyfriend, let’s call him O, has allowed his brother 26M, let’s call him G, to live with us for the past 3 months. G has a notorious past of living with multiple people, including his sisters, and eventually being kicked out. G is unsanitary, unhygienic and sloppy. Above all that he is very ungrateful. These past three months I had to clean up his mess, cook dinner, do his laundry, and i can’t even get a thank you. Me and my boyfriend O went on vacation to Spain last week, and when we came back home on saturday our house was a full blown mess. My mom and his aunt came over to check on our pets and the house every other day and it was messy every time, my pets didn’t have any food or water. We were livid. Now here’s the thing: my boyfriend O is very soft and kind in nature. He tried to have a talk with his brother G about his behavior. As i had guessed, this talk didn’t yield anything. We have talked with G over and over, he has debts up to 20k. I’m the complete opposite and i’m fed up, to word it lightly. I’m planning on packing his stuff this afternoon, locking the front door (because G has a key) and texting him, telling him his stuff is packed and ready to go. He still owes my boyfriend around €500 for rent and consumption. I’m afraid my boyfriend won’t receive his money. Overall this is a complicated and very frustrating situation and i’m at my wits end with this guy. He also has lied about so many things. He has pretended to leave for work and ends up not going. He lies about his debts. My boyfriend works shifts, and 2 days ago his brother brought in a girl to our home without telling us. So, AITA for kicking his brother out because my boyfriend doesn’t dare?",

      "body": "I (late 20s) live with Emma (mid 20s), who doesn’t go out much or have many friends. She has a traditional mindset and says things like “women who party too much aren’t wife material,” but still tries to come off as trendy and social.\n\nI’ve brought her twice to hang out with Noah, a close friend of mine, and our circle of international friends. The group speaks three languages, and Emma doesn’t speak any fluently, so I’ve always translated for her, which I honestly don’t mind. What’s exhausting is that she doesn’t just want help, she wants me to stop enjoying myself to be her wingwoman and social buffer all night.\n\nShe barely interacts with them directly, unless I’m guiding everything. Yet she follows them online, talks about them like they’re her close friends, and acts like she’s part of the group, even though every interaction has gone through me. At home, she constantly asks about them and analyzes their posts like she’s fantasizing a bond that isn’t really there.\n\nShe’s pretty, and yeah, people want to dance or talk to her. But she struggles to hold a conversation (even in her own language) unless I’m hovering nearby. She turns hangouts into this subtle “audition,” trying to seem like perfect girlfriend/wife material. It feels like a weird competition from her, one I’m not even in, bc these are my friends. I’m not trying to impress anyone.\n\nNoah recently invited me to a small hangout, and I want to bring Nina (a friend who also met him through me). Nina speaks their languages and is chill, social, and easy to be around. I can relax when she’s there, bc she doesn’t make it weird or emotionally draining.\n\nEmma is supposed to be out of town that weekend. I stupidly hinted Noah might be around, and now she’s all excited, acting like she’ll run into him. I’m worried she’ll cancel her trip and try to join if she finds out. \n\nI haven’t told her and I do feel guilty, but I just want one stress-free night with people I care about, without playing translator, babysitter, or emotional handler… especially when I already struggle socially myself, lol.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: I brought my socially awkward roommate to hang out with my friend group twice. I ended up having to translate, guide, and manage her while she treated it like a performance or competition. Now there’s another hangout and I haven’t told her, because I just want to enjoy my night in peace. AITA?\n",

      "body": "My best friend and I (20F) recently went on a trip to the UK. I actually have a UK passport since my dad is British, but my friend had to get a UK visa. We were supposed to take two flights, one that would arrive in France, and a connecting flight that would fly to the UK.\n\nHowever, the second flight ended up being cancelled. The next available flight wasn’t until 2 pm the next day, so we would have to wait around 17 hours. The passengers were allowed to stay in nearby hotels for free. However, this didn’t apply to people like my friend, who wasn’t legally allowed to leave the airport because she didn’t have a visa for Europe.\n\nInstead, she had to stay within a specific area of the airport that had these bright ceiling lights that would stay on 24/7. There was construction nearby, so there was this extremely loud drilling noise every so often. All the available seats were taken by other passengers, so my friend had to sleep on the floor. Plus, earlier that day, water got spilled on our phone chargers, and her phone was only on 40%.\n\nI had the option to stay with her, but I chose to go to the hotel instead. She was furious with me, accusing me of being a fake friend. She told me she was scared of being alone in a creepy unknown place and wanted me there to comfort her, and I assured her that I’ll be back by the morning. She said I was acting selfish for not even spending one night with her, but I hadn’t gotten any sleep in over 24 hours, and I didn’t see why both of us had to suffer. AITA?",

      "body": "When my (27F) fiancé and I first announced my pregnancy to my family, my sister (34F) was a little jealous, I'm assuming it's because she was trying for a baby with her ex partner but they broke up because he was a cheat. \n\nI gave birth to my daughter seven months ago. Her name is Kaia. When I returned to work after 12 weeks of maternity leave, my sister offered to babysit Kaia once a week which has been incredibly helpful. \n\nNot too long ago, one of my close friends who also recently had a child approached me to tell me that my sister is in a mothers group on Facebook and she's posting photos of Kaia and she's calling my daughter HERS and she's also calling her by a different name. My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fiancé and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. Therefore I told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. My sister flipped out and said that I can't take Kaia away from her and then called me a \"selfish b!tch\" and she started crying. I have NEVER seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. I ask her if there's anything else I need to know because she may as well just spill everything, so she shows me a framed photo she has in her bedroom of her and my daughter and on the frame is written \"mother and daughter.\" I'm not going to lie, I did call her crazy and then I left and haven't spoken to her since, although she continues to try and come over and calls me multiple times a day.\n\nMy mind is an absolute mess. I don't know where we go from here. AITA for how I handled the situation?",

      "body": "**UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGE**\n\nThis happened last night but my phone is still blowing up. \n\nI F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday. \n\nHe knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We’ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn’t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. \n\nSome background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. \n\nI found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn’t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. \n\nAfter finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.\n\nI was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn’t bother him.\n\nLast night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.\n\nHis best female friend Jessica laughed and said “I wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.”\n\nI looked at her with an “excuse me?” Look on my face and she just said “nevermind” and walked away. \n\nI confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote “she’s just messing with you. You can’t take a joke?”\n\nSo I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said “well, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.” \n\nI asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said “you know…messing with best friends?” \n\nHe then pat me on the shoulder and said that it’s okay because I’m not who I was back then and if he could get over my “colourful past” and “thot mentalities” to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica’s comments and give her another chance.\n\nI didn’t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.\n\nHe was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn’t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.\n\nI thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they’re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. \n\nI responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn’t a “thot” and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. \n\nHe started screaming how I’m “the biggest AH” for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my “colourful past.” \n\nI’m thinking maybe taking it back went too far. \n\nAITA?",

One of the kids at the party asked if we had any bologna - told him no bologna only hot dogs and hamburgers and jokingly said “but hot dogs and bologna are basically the same meat just in a different form”, kid didn’t take either grabbed some chips and went off and did their thing with the other kids. \n\nAbout 2 hours after the party I get a text from the kids dad which I found a bit odd. We went to school from kindergarten to graduating university, but not let’s go do something this weekend kinda friends. \n\nIn the text he is losing his mind that I ruined the one food they could rely on him eating - bologna - because I said it was the same meat as a hot dog and explained that their son is a very picky eater. \n\nI genuinely feel bad because I know how hard it can be to feed a kid when they don’t want anything you cook, but I had no idea how deep it ran with their son. \n\nThe hosts, texting me asking if the other friend reached out and said that I did nothing wrong and that it was being blown way out of proportion, and if the kid had such a good aversion it should have been brought up before hand by the parents, but I can’t help feeling like a total jerk all afternoon. \n\nAITA?",

      "body": "This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. \n\nHe and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. \n\nYesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. \n\nBrenda messages the group saying \"maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts\" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. \n\nMe: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol\n\nBrenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband\n\nMe: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important\n\nBrenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. \n\nMe: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single\n\nNow apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I \"mocked her for being single in her 40s\". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. \n\nAITA reddit?\n\nEdit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.\n\nEdit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying \"sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol.\" \n\nHe's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said \"oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.\"",

My sister is due to give birth soon and decided this dinner would be the perfect time to announce the name she chose for her first child\n\nMy sister has always been obssesed with aesthetics, her whole house is beige and rather depressing if im honest. The whole nursery she built for baby is beige and grey and will not accept colourful gifts for the baby. I can tell her husband hates it but he won't admit it.\n\nNow here is the issue, i am very prone to laughing at inappropriate times. I am autistic and find it hard to filter what I say and my emotions, which can lead to me reacting to things in ways that can offend people. I didn't think this would cause issues, until she revealed the name of her baby\n\nSo, we are all done with our dinner, we are looking at my sister as announces her baby will be named..\n\nBrookleeigh-Willow Rose [Insert Surname, not including it for privacy]\n\nSpelt EXACTLY like that.\n\nAnd then i burst out laughing, and said 'You cannot be serious'\n\nI am now banned from all family dinners\n\nIs the name really that bad? Was I really a massive asshole?\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter writing this post I decided to call my sister and apologise, as when i wrote down what happened i did realise what a dick move that was. I said I was sorry for laughing and I apologised for using my mental disability as an excuse and offered to treat her to lunch as an apology\n\nUnderstanably she was reluctant to forgive me, but she did which i am thankful for. She said she was hurt by my actions which I understood but was willing to look past it. \n\nI knew posting this story on here would give me the slap in the face that I needed which I appreciate\n\nAnd if anyones wondering, the name is staying. I didnt comment at all on it",

      "body": "I’m 31F and my mom (Brenda, 55F) and I are honestly pretty close. But there’s this one thing she does that’s been getting under my skin for years. Basically, if I tell her anything about my life, she’ll go and talk about it with the whole extended family. Like... everyone. Aunts, uncles, cousins, even random relatives I barely know or haven’t seen in forever. Nothing’s too small—she’ll mention stuff about who I’m seeing, stuff with my job, health stuff, money stuff... just everything.\n\nI’ve told her to stop doing that so many times. Like I’ll say “hey, I don’t want anyone else knowing about this,” and she’ll nod like she gets it—but then later I hear she’s been talking. And when I call her out, she always says something like, “Oh, come on, it’s just family!” or “I wasn’t gossiping, I was just chatting.” Like??? That doesn’t really make it better.\n\nAnyway, not long ago I had this minor medical thing done—nothing serious, but definitely personal. I told her ahead of time, super clearly, that I didn’t want anyone else knowing. Just wanted to keep it to myself.\n\nThen like three days later, I start getting these “how are you feeling??” texts from a bunch of my aunts. And yep—turns out my mom told them. Again.\n\nI was honestly so frustrated. I called her and told her straight up that I felt like she didn’t respect my privacy, and that I was hurt she went and told people again after I asked her not to. I told her I need her to stop sharing my life like that—it’s not just casual chatting when it’s stuff I asked her to keep private.\n\nShe got really upset. Said I was attacking her, said I was overreacting and being cold, and now she won’t talk to me. My dad says I should’ve handled it “more gently” and that I made her feel bad. So now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far.\n\nWas I the asshole for putting my foot down?",

      "body": "This happened a few years ago now but I was reminded of it recently and wanted a second opinion.\n\nSo I (17-18f at the time) was driving my sister’s (21f) fiance (22m) to his job every day because my sister was pregnant and didn’t want to drive.\n\nHis job was about an hour away and he had to be there by 5am so I’d have to get up around 3:30 to leave around 4 and by the time I’d get back was around 6-6:30am.\n\nI did that for a couple months, and though it was rough, I still did it for her. Though it got even harder when my mom started working a morning shift and she asked me to watch my grandma as well. Feeling like I couldn’t say no, I told her I would. So now I’m waking up at 3:30, coming home around 6-6:30, and then having to watch my grandma from 7am to 3-4pm depending on when my mom got off work.\n\nI did that for about a little over 2 weeks, but I was barely getting any sleep. I’ve also always had troubles with falling asleep so there were nights where I had zero to maybe a couple hours of sleep before I had to get up.\n\nBeing extremely tired by the time I’d get home, I asked my mom if I could nap. But because of how my grandma was, she said I couldn’t in case she did something and I needed to stop her or help her. (quick side note, my grandma had Alzheimers and dementia. She would sometimes do things that could put her in danger of getting hurt or injured)\n\nSo now I was barely getting any sleep and it was getting harder to be able to stay awake for my grandma.\n\nI finally asked my sister if there was any way she could watch grandma in the mornings so I could get a couple hours of sleep, then I’d take over watching her for the rest of the time. But because my sister’s relationship with our grandma had always been kinda rocky, she refused.\n\nI know her and our grandma didn’t really get along, and our grandma was never really the best person. Trust me, I had to go through years of her abuse too, so I get it. But I was starting to get in trouble by my mom when she’d come home and I had passed out at some point in the day from exhaustion. I was also having a hard time doing the chores she wanted me to do, and I just didn’t know what to do anymore. So I finally told my sister that if she wasn’t going to watch grandma in the morning, I wouldn’t drive her fiance to work anymore.\n\nShe got pissed and told me I was being selfish. She then used her pregnancy as reason why she couldn’t drive. She kept throwing stuff in my face about how horrible I was for refusing to help her when all she asked me to do was drive her fiance. I told her that I could still drive him if she would just watch grandma in the mornings. She refused to watch her, so I refused to drive him any longer.\n\nFor a bit after that, she never missed the opportunity to remind me how horrible I was. Or she’d make sly comments meant to make me feel bad. And it worked. I felt horrible for doing that to my sister, especially since she was pregnant. But I just couldn’t do both things anymore.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "I had a boss who was a real turd. He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn’t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn’t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. \n\nI turned in my two weeks and he said “oh sweetie, you know you can’t leave.” I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said “Well, I’m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you’re here to stay.” I got so furious and decided that was it. I said “well screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.” Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. \n\nA former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I’m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I’m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I’m curious, I thought I’d ask here. AITA?",

      "body": "Hey im an old guy who has never posted on reddit, but at the urging of my neice and nephew I'm going to attempt to post this here :)\n\nSo I (50M) have a neice and a nephew who are both 18 and just graduated. A few years ago when they were entering HS I made a deal with them, if they kept a B average their entire time in high school I would buy them any car of their choosing, within reason of course. We added a clause that they got 1 semester forgiven, so they were able to mess up one semester and I wouldn't hold it against them, I felt like 7/8 semesters with a b average was pretty fair. \n\nSo my neice maintained her grades, she did mess up her sophomore year but otherwise was right on track. My nephew on the other hand pretty much never did right, we were lucky that he even passed every semester. I offered help, tutors, books, tried to make sure he was okay mentally, whatever he needed but turns out he just straight up was not doing his work. He was doing good on tests but would never do his actual work resulting in his grades being low. \n\nSo last week was when my neice got her car, she choose a 2025 Toyota camry. My nephew kept asking when he was going to get his, and I told him he didn't stick to his end of the agreement so he did not get a car. He still got a very nice gift back at graduation. Now, him and his mom are angry with me and saying im favoring my neice and now he is refusing to speak to me or his sister. I don't think I messed up but I'm starting to worry, AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?",
      "body": "Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.\n\nThat was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would \"basically be the same thing\". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for \"shaming him and his wife on the internet\". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",

Her dad walked out on her as a kid, and her stepdad is an awful person. I asked her to just drop it but she just doubled down.

      "body": "My mother passed away 3 years ago. The family home, where I and my sister grew up, was willed to me. It was her ancestral property, and she wanted her daughter to have it.

      "title": "AITA for telling my parents to not include my stepdaughter in their will?",
      "body": "Throw away account …\n\nI (35f) have 2 kids (17 m/f twins) and 1 stepdaughter (18) who I met when she was 11. \n\nThe other day, I was at my parents house going over some estate planning as I am the executor. While reviewing, I saw my folks had split their assets to be half for my 2 siblings and I and the other half for their grandkids—all to be distributed evenly. My stepdaughter was included. When I asked them about this, they said they wanted to be fair. Their estate isn’t super large, but the sum would be substantial (think new car). \n\nI told my parents that while generous of them, I didn’t think it would be necessary and would be better to split between their 5 grandkids. \n\nWhen we got home, my husband said he overheard what I said and that I was being an AH for alienating his daughter. \n\nI told him my reasoning was because she is the only child/grandchild/niece on both her parent’s sides and that she would be set. Her grandparents own multiple properties, her uncles are fairly well off and live in a HCOL area, and well, she’s the only kid and it’s not looking like (at least in his side) that she’ll have any cousins. Plus, their collective net worth is substantially more than my side. I also asked him if his parents included my kids in their estate, but he refused to answer. \n\nStill. He said I was being an AH and accused me of not caring about her future. I think I was doing the right thing by looking out for my kids and their cousins. AITA? \n\nEdit: I was told to include this in the post-\n\n1- I didn’t argue with or pressure my parents to make a change. I simply mentioned that I don’t feel it was necessary for her to receive a monetary amount. \n\n2- my mom plans on giving her a set of family heirloom jewelry that is her birthstone. I think this is quite thoughtful. I’m not a big jewelry person and she has other sets for the other girls in the family so I feel this is ok. \n\n3- my parents have seen her about 3-5x a year since I met her.\n\n4- my nephews and my kids do not have active relationships with their biological father sides. My niece is a new mom and works at a restaurant. I feel that financial inheritance would be more impactful for them even as such a small amount. \n\n5- I know my SD is set to inherit at least 2 houses in a major us city with HCOL.  I found this out a while back after my husband asked me to help him organize his office. I had to read through papers to know how to file them accordingly. The paper was a certified copy and was drafted soon after we married. My kids were not included. I am not sure if it has been updated. I did not ask him about it at the time because I did not have an issue with it. \n\n6- There is distance in the relationship but I don’t feel it’s my fault. I can explain this. When I met her mom for the first time, she made it very clear that I wasn’t her mom. I didn’t see this as an issue because I did not want to overstep and as a mom myself, I could see where she was coming from and respected her request. \n\nBut as time progressed, our opportunity to spend time together became less frequent. At first my husband had every other weekend visitation. It became less frequent as she became a teenager because she wanted to spend the night with friends, hang out, etc which I see as normal teenager behavior. The other piece is that we were never invited to be included in major celebrations for her. We usually celebrated birthdays with her a week after because we weren’t invited (my husband was-just not us). She’s also never spent Thanksgiving or Christmas with us because her mom wanted those days. Again, which I saw as fine because that’s her only child. My husband would spend holidays with her at her mom’s house which I encouraged because I knew the importance of father/daughter connections. We also were not invited to her HS graduation. \n\nI think she’s a beautiful and brilliant young woman and care for her tremendously. But It’s challenging to develop deep meaningful relationships with people you have little contact with.\n\n7- for people putting me in the category of the evil stepmother, saying that I see her as other, don’t think that I haven’t been trying since the beginning. I include her in every way I can in the times that she is with us by doing things like teaching her my family recipes, taking her shopping for clothes so that she doesn’t have to bring things back-and-forth, and attending every school athletic event that I could. \n\nI have tried to include her in family vacation planning, but was told by her mother that unless the vacation occurred on a weekend we’re scheduled to have with her then she would not allow us to have the time. This limited our options to local weekend trips but even then, her mom comes up with some reason she can’t join—including surprise trips to another state. I even suggested a family cruise in lieu of a honeymoon to celebrate our new family but was blocked by her mom. My husband is allowed to take her on extended vacations as long as it’s just the two of them.  \n\nI have tried to be flexible in accommodations around holidays by postponing things like Christmas morning so that she can be included. This created frustration in my kids because they felt like they shouldn’t have to put their lives aside to accommodate for her. One year when the holiday occurred on one of our planned weekends, I came up with the suggestion of celebrating Christmas on Christmas Eve so we could do the full family thing. My kids weren’t thrilled, but they understood. In the end we didn’t end up spending any time with her as her mom told us that she planned on having a dinner party on Christmas Eve and needed my stepdaughter to help her prepare. \n\nWhen the time came for college applications, I was ecstatic to be asked by my stepdaughter to help her with the applications, but soon after was told that her mom hired a professional to help her get into her top choice schools and I was no longer needed. \n\nI have tried to have a bond with her with the little time that I have. I have consistently brought up to my husband that I feel like we needed more time with her to help build our relationship at the very least by him maintaining his every other weekend schedule. He has told me that ultimately her mom is her mom and she determines her schedule and how she spends her time. He has also expressed that he fears that if he undermines her mom, then he might lose the time and relationship that he does have with her and I do not want to be the reason for any sort of break in their relationship. His time/relationship with her hasn’t changed, so maybe he doesn’t see the need for me/my kids to be involved. But If he doesn’t advocate for us, then what am I supposed to do? \n\n\n**** Major update ****\n\nI haven’t had the opportunity to have a discussion with my husband about all of this, as I was waiting to speak with my therapist to get advice on the best way to approach the conversation. \n\nHowever, I did receive a phone call this morning from my father-in-law who I see as an absolute angel of a man. Apparently, my husband told his mom about our argument and my mother-in-law went off and this is how my father-in-law found out about it. FIL asked me what my side of the story was and I very emotionally told him everything as I listed in the OP. I told him it was not my intention to alienate SD in anyway and that this whole thing has created a nightmare.\n\nAfter deep breath and slight pause, my FIL said that I did the right thing. A few years ago, my FIL suffered a series of strokes. He said that this prompted him to want to reevaluate the estate to make sure that everything was in order. He is quite old (close to 90) and has a lot of underlying health issues. He and my MIL share all of their assets and she is also his POA in case anything happens, and because they have a family trust, he wanted to include her and his sons in the discussion. \n\nHe told me that he brought up that he wanted to include my children in the family trust. He told me he proposed to allow for 10% of the trusts liquid assets to be split between my two kids to help get a start on life. He then said that my MIL pushed back very hard saying that because my children were not biologically related to their family and they should not be considered. When he asked my husband his thoughts on it, FIL said my husbands response was that it was best to “keep it in the family” but that he would “consider” including us in his portion upon his passing if he and I were still together. FIL said this was a surprise because at that point we were still basically newlyweds and was surprised a new husband would even think that way. My MILs response to that was unhappy saying again we weren’t blood and that this was a family issue. Because of the stress caused by the situation, and because of the recent strokes, FIL did not want to press things further. \n\nFIL said afterwards, he pulled my husband aside to find out more about what he had meant and to be assured that my kids would be included and was basically told by my husband that he would do what was “best for his family” and the conversation was dropped. \n\nNow, FIL said that he didn’t push further at this point because he was getting tired from the conversation. But in light of what’s happening and how my MIL and husband are responding behind closed doors, he felt it was necessary to let me know. \n\nHe said that SD is set to be more than ok when it comes time, and that my husband has asked to tap into funds to pay for her college so she would not need to take out any loans, which he agreed to. He said he asked my husband if he would do the same for my kids and that my husbands response was that he would ask when the time came as my kids did not yet know what was going to happen regarding college admissions.  \n\nFIL asked me if my husband and I had this conversation. I told him that my husband and I discussions about my kids school was that they would need to take out loans, finish college, and then we would help pay off half of the loans together once they graduated. My husband has NEVER suggested that anything for my kids college would be paid for through his family trust. \n\nMy FIL was very apologetic, saying he should have pushed further as he loves us greatly and feels like he did not do enough. I told him it was not his fault and that he should not feel responsible for any of this, and that I did not want him to feel obligated to make any changes or bring it up with MIL/husband because I knew it would create additional stress for him and I wanted him to take care of his peace. \n\nHe said though his desire would be to do so, that since his wife and he have a joint estate, and that she is POA, that he felt like it would be more trouble than it’s worth. He is blind and has a lot of mobility issues so anything he does he is dependent on her. He also said that based on what he’s heard on his side, he felt if he did update his will, then they would likely contest it which would create a financial burden on my end and he didn’t want to create a negative situation. \n\nI told him again that it was ok and that we would be ok in life and that he was not responsible for anything that happened. I told him that my intention wasn’t to be added to the trust, just to make a point to my husband to which he said he understood and agreed. He apologized again, we told each other how much we loved one another and he ended the call saying he considered me a “person of integrity which is a rare gem.”\n\nNow that I have this information, I feel like this whole situation brought to light a lot of things I hadn’t considered regarding my marriage. Also, writing out everything regarding how my husband navigated his relationship with his daughter/ex wife really put things into perspective that makes me feel like we were never a priority for him. \n\nI’m not sure where to go from here. I plan to bring this all up with my therapist and talk it out to figure out what I should do. But I no longer feel like the AH for advocating for my biological family because my husband and his side have been advocating for theirs (FIL excluded). \n\n**** Final Update-\n\nI’ve had many people reach out for an update so here it is … I will be divorcing my husband. \n\nA lot has happened since I posted this. Thank you to those who responded and PM’d me kind words of encouragement that helped me take a step back and evaluate the dynamics of my marriage. \n\nThis whole situation was much bigger than my comment to my parents. And despite everything, I am thankful it was a catalyst for truth rather than wasting more years of my life, love, and energy. \n\nFirst, I did try to speak to my husband. Whenever I brought it up he said that he was over the issue. I mentioned to him that I thought it would be good for us to attend couples counseling to work out our differences with a neutral party to help us build a stronger relationship. He agreed and I honored his requests for the type of counselor he wanted to see. However, when the appointment times came, he no-showed citing that things came up at work or he wasn’t feeling up to it. He missed a total of 3 appointments that I ended up attending myself. The counselor helped me recognize some potential covert narcissist traits based on my version of things. The counselor said they couldn’t say for sure these things were true nor could they provide a diagnosis, but from what I said and husbands no shows, they felt it was highly likely. \n\nThe frustration caused by all of this made me decide to take my kids to see my brother and his family for Halloween and the weekend. They live close to a city that goes all out for the holiday and it’s within a reasonable driving distance. My husband didn’t object. I asked him if he had plans and he said he was just going to work around the house and relax. He assumed that I would be with them the whole time. I took my twins, spent the night, and left them there hoping to be able to go home and have a serious conversation with my husband without distractions. On the way home, my daughter called me. She said that there was a post-Halloween party happening at our house and that both SD and her mom were there. She found out because one of her teammates from school’s older sister had been invited. The sister is friends with SD. She also sent me screen shots from social media from the inside of our home where I could see who was in attendance. I didn’t recognize anyone except Husband, SD, and SDs mom. When I got home Friday evening, I pulled up to the house and it was filled with cars including SDs mom. I didn’t knock because I was already embarrassed as it is. Instead, I went to stay with a friend. \n\nThe next morning, I went home to confront my husband. All the cars were gone except SDs mom. A woman who refused to knock on our door during pick-ups/drop-offs had spent the night at our home. \n\nWhen I let myself in, all 3 were eating breakfast around the table like a family. SDs mom gave me a big smile and exaggerated hospitality. SD tried hard to hide her giggles. Husband was bewildered. There was no evidence of a major party.  SDs mom said she’d see him later and left with SD. SD did not acknowledge me besides her laughing which continued on her way out of the door. I’m not a confrontational person by nature so I didn’t stop them to question. I asked him to explain. He tried to say that they had just come over for breakfast. I told him I knew that wasn’t the case because I drove by last night. He kept denying but I pressed. I didn’t tell him about the social media.\n\nHe tried to gaslight me saying that I lied to him about being gone all weekend. I told him I was taking the kids to see my brother for the weekend but didn’t say I’d be staying with them. I brought up that he lied to me about working around the house. He said the party was a last min request from SDs mom to host for her friends. All of the guests were HER friends. And the amount of guests suggests it was likely planned the moment I mentioned I’d be going out of town. I questioned about her spending the night but he said she slept in the guest bed because she was too drunk to drive but I doubt it. \n\nI asked him if he even wanted to be married. He said yes. But that his priority is his daughter—who is now in college. I asked what that had to do with her mom and having parties in the home we share—especially now that she is a legal adult. He said that he will “always love her as the mother of his child.”  We agreed early in our relationship that we wouldn’t have kids as we’d essentially be starting over, so this statement hurt me on so many levels. \n\nI told him that his lies and mistreatment of me was over. That he never prioritized our marriage and always put his “first family” before us. He said I was delusional. I told him not to be home when I came back to get my stuff. \n\nI called my kids to tell them what happened. They said they weren’t surprised. Apparently, they’ve been feeling some type of was towards him for a while and felt they couldn’t tell me because they knew how important marriage was to me (my parents were an example of what I wanted to have in my own life). I felt like shit for creating that kind of break with my kids. They were gracious and told me I deserved better. I told them they could come home or stay with my brother and they decided to stay. But yes … I am the AH for prioritizing my marriage over my kids.  And I will be setting up family therapy for us. \n\nI went and rented a 3 bedroom apartment the same day. The friend I stayed with the night before helped me pack my stuff and move over the weekend. Future ex husbands whereabouts were unknown but I can assume…\n\nDuring the move I got a string of nasty texts from SDs mom saying that I was jealous that she had picked a good man who she conceived a baby with love with—a direct jab at the circumstances under which I had my kids (their dad is an addict and not in the picture). She said I’d never have what they have. \n\nMy understanding of the circumstances of their divorce was that she had an affair. When we first met I explicitly asked if she was ok with me and him dating (at that time). She said she had no issue, and that she was glad he was happy (this was the same day as her comment about me never being \"mom\" to step daughter).  She was also dating someone at the time. \n\nOnce I got settled, I told my family about what happened (parents and siblings). They were livid. Especially my dad. This is where he voiced that he had been sick of trying to include my husband/SD in family events just to be constantly stonewalled by them. They don’t take blatant cruelty lightly and her reaction to my walking in on their breakfast makes them see her as cruel. They said if she had shown even a bit of embarrassment or remorse, they would’ve thought differently of her. \n\nSo yes… I’m the asshole for overlooking my future ex’s treatment of me and my family. For delusionally thinking things would get better. For pouring into people who don’t seem to GAF while I had love and support from my real family. \n\nI will say, I don’t blame my SD for this. She is her parent’s child. Who knows what was said about me behind closed doors over the years. In that case, she is innocent. However, she is now an adult that can make her own choices. She can decide if she wants to participate in behavior that puts other people down. Maybe she’s still young enough to be influenced under her parent’s thumb regarding how she treats people. Maybe one day she will realize that she can speak up when she sees bullying behavior by members of her own family. But I won’t be around to find out. \n\nI still talk to my FIL. He’s been checking in on me regularly while MIL is out running errands. He’s sorry for the circumstances but glad I stood up for myself. He told me he will help me in any way he can to make my transition easier. I said the best he can do for me is still be my friend. Now he tells me stories about his younger years instead of us talking about other parties involved. \n\nMy kids like our new place. They said school is still doing ok and are looking forward to graduating. We decided to adopt a cat. Something we all wanted but put off because ex hates them. Both have decided to pursue complementing trades and going into business together after college. They said they had been discussing it for a while. They had mentioned it to me before alongside a long list of other possible post-graduation plans so I was aware of it as a possibility, but now they say it’s the goal. \n\nI also told my parents that if they wanted to reconsider their will, then I wanted them to decide to do something that made them happy—even if it included SD. They said they had already been talking to a financial advisor after speaking with my brother since the time of our meeting mentioned in the original post. He encouraged them to enjoy their money now. They want to move to my paternal grandparents home country where we have some extended family. Moving will save them a lot of money as the COL is much lower and he can buy land since my dad is a dual citizen. They said if it works out, they’ll leave their house here for my sister and her boys to live in rent free as long as she keeps up maintenance. They also mentioned the possibility of contributing to my niece going back to school so she doesn’t have to work as a server much longer. All this planning on their end started just before the Halloween fall out. I told them I’m glad they’re deciding to enjoy their money while they’re still around. \n\nHusband has reached out several times begging me to reconcile, asking for marriage counseling, etc. I guess he thought I wasn’t as serious as I was. Said he made a big mistake and put the blame on SDs mom/his mom for “poisoning” him regarding our marriage. Told him it was not my problem and that I hope he has the life he deserves. \n\nIf I could tell my younger self something it would be don’t ignore the red flags. If things feel off or unfair, then they probably are. Don’t prioritize people who couldn’t care less about your feelings or overall wellbeing. People can change, but it’s not your responsibility to help them. Invest that energy in yourself. I’m SO GLAD I kept my job/income despite my husband’s request for me to be a housewife. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have been able to leave as quickly as I did. \n\nTLDR - told my parents I thought it wasn’t necessary to include SD in their will because she’s set to inherit a lot from my husband’s family.  Husband got pissed and said I was alienating his daughter. Later got a call from my FIL saying I wasn’t the AH. Now I’m leaving my husband. ",

      "body": "\nHi Reddit, I turned 18 (female) yesterday but it seems to caused a bit of drama in my family so im asking for honest, objective opinions on whether im wrong. I’m using a throwaway account because this situation is obviously very humiliating for me\n\nFor reference, my weight has always been made fun of in my family. My aunt specifically has always been very unkind and fat shamed me, even when I was younger and struggling with my body image. She used to tell me that my clothes looked so small on me, and that even her clothes are probably small for me. She used to remind me to go on diets constantly. Im currently 320lbs if it adds contexts too \n\nI hadn’t seen my aunt in a while and for the most part I was really glad to see her for my birthday. I was slightly dreading if she would say anything to me because im aware I have gained a lot of weight since I last saw her, but she just made a few comments so I thought it was the end of it. \n\nI was opening a birthday card she gave me a few hours later and it had money in it, with a note that said “money for weight watchers, make some real change for once”. This was humiliating and I asked her about it and she said that she could tell I was miserable and that I probably look really good underneath the fat. She said this in front of my parents, and it was very embarrassing. I told her im not accepting the gift and she’s making me look stupid, but she said that she was just worried for me and my health. I don’t believe this, she’s made fun of my weight for years even before I was a teenager. But my parents think I was overreacting and I should’ve just accepted it. My aunt has a notoriously big mouth and my parents think she’s going to tell our whole family so they’re getting kind of worried about what I’ve done. AITA?",

      "body": "I've been seeing my fiance for 4 years now and I came in to the relationship with 2 boys. My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\". AITA?",

My sister has an upcoming conference for an internship in DC and asked to stay at my apartment. I told my sister that she is more than welcome to stay with me, but she first needs to admit to lying and apologize. She is refusing to do what I asked, so I have informed her that she will need to get a hotel room. I know my sister is more than financially capable of affording a hotel room, and I would not have done this if she couldn't.

So I know that me leaving especially with no warning will cause more than a few problems for both of them. Especially my stepdad who has been having a lot of health issues that I help book appointments for because my mom simply won’t.

Jason (not real name) lives stays in one of the upstairs rooms, and I live in the other. Isaac (not real name) lives in the basement, which is huge as it used to be a pub cellar, and is the size of the entire upstairs. \n\nI work from an office 3 days per week, and work 2 days either in my room or a cafe from my laptop. Jason works in hospitality so isn't here much. Isaac used to be office based, but decided to quit his job about 6 months ago and go into consulting, which means he works from home constantly, but has basically set up an office in our front room, where our TV and sofas are - basically where we chill. At the beginning this didn't bother me much, but now he takes calls all the time, with his camera on which means I basically can't use the room when he's in there. I've asked him to stop taking calls upstairs, and he flipped out saying he can't be expected to work in a basement with no windows (despite this being what he pays for. We all pay the same rent btw, and I have the smallest room).

      "body": "I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. \n\nAt the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. \n\nVince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. \n\nWhen I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. \n\nLast year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I’m incredibly proud of him.\n\nLast week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. \n\nLeo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. \n\nAt the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. \n\nAlba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. \n\nAs we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).\n\nI told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn’t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. \n\nAlba was deeply hurt by what I’ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that\nI was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize. \n\n___________\n\nSmall update: first of all I want to thank you all for your replies :) \n\nI wanted to address a couple of things, many of you asked why Alba and I remained friends despite her previous remarks. Alba and I grew apart during our third year in university, we only remained friends by association since we have a lot of shared mutual friends. \n\nWe became close again after our sons started playing basketball together at the local community center and became friends. I figured that becoming a mother made her more mature and she didn’t give me any reason to suspect otherwise. \n\nI’ve decided to send her a message saying that the way she spoke about my husband and son was unacceptable and therefore she is no longer welcomed in my home, however, I don’t want our sons to lose their friendship and therefore I’m willing to remain civil around the kids and still organize play dates. She didn’t reply to me just yet, but I truly hope she loves her son enough to put her ego aside and remain civil for the sake of our kids.\n\nI’ve yet to notify Vince about this entire situation since he is vigorously studying for an important quiz that’s coming up next week, and I know that if he heard what Alba said about him and our boy it would make him upset and he won’t be able to continue studying properly. Unless something crazy happens in the meantime I’ll probably update him next week after he’s done with the quiz. \n",

His parents, my aunt and uncle, made arrangements for him to be sent to one of those awful camps that claim they could \"cure\" him. A kid in his community was forced to go and came back and was clearly not well, so Jake didn't want to go.\n\nJake ran away from home, and jumped from one family house to another. His folks didn't file a missing person report because they didn't want to look bad to their neighbors. They just told them that he went to that camp willingly.\n\nHe dissapeared in the middle of october, and turned up in my city a week later. After making sure he was safe to bring home, my wife and I allowed him to stay. He didn't want me to tell the rest of the family for a while, because those people at the camp keep showing up to take him.\n\nI made sure to talk to a lawyer, who assured Jake that they cannot take him. Three days ago, he told his parents he was here. A few hours later, those damn camp people showed up, but they were unable to take him.\n\nMy family has been blowing up my phone for the last two days angry that I didn't tell someone sooner. Well, jake didn't feel safe yet, and still doesn't. I wanted to make sure he was ready.\n\nStill, even those that want to protect Jake is upset with me for hiding him.\n\nAITA for not telling anyone that he is here until he was ready?\n\nEDIT:  Wow, thank you all for the awards. I don't deserve them but thanks. Since I am drinking coffee and slowly going through the comments I thought I should say a few things.\n\nFirst off, while I figured I wasn't the AH for hiding him from my more narrow minded family, it was those that really wanted to help jake that made me feel guilty. They were all scared out of their minds and wanted the peace to know he was ok. I felt bad for not telling them. Though i am sure they wouldn't had turned him in, I felt bad because we were working on keeping him safe.\n\nAlso,  we got a lawyer who got the police on the look out for those camp people in case they try anything. Jake is not going out alone until we are sure he is safe.\n\nThird, we are looking on how to get his paper work, like his birth certificate, here because no way he trusts his parents to just hand them over. My granny in law is talking to some people that could help.\n\nFourth, Jake says hello and thank you.\n\nOh and we're Catholic, not Christian. We're our own special type of jacka$$es.\n\nEDIT Once again: ok you're right about the Catholic/Christian thing. I was raised to split hairs, I apologize.",

      "body": "\nMy M46 daughter (16) is a highschool junior. I noticed recently that she's been behaving in a bad manner constantly commenting on other people's looks, belongings, calling them stuff that isn't cool and just being  insensitive. It's like she lost a filter or something because usually she's polite but my wife suspected that our daughter's sudden misbehavior occurred after she started hanging out with new girls from the school. Basically the mean type and have picked on their behavior. I've sat with my daughter and had many discussions about how her behavior has been negatively affecting everyone around her. Our housemaid is the person most affected here and my daughter has chosen her to be her target for hair, clothes, \"etiquette\" criticism. She has complained about our daughter calling her offensive names like filthy and gross for cleaning certain areas in our house. I took a stand and explicitly told my daughter I'd punish her if she ever said stuff like that to our housemaid again.\n\n\nLast week my daughter had a party to go to, earlier that day she called our housemaid \"filthy\" so I grounded her by not letting her go to the party. She threw a fit and called our housemaid a liar saying she never called her that. That was the end of it.\n\nDays later my daughter came to me saying she couldn't find her iPhone after looking everywhere. She asked me to call her number and I did. My wife and I were stunned to discover that the iphone was ringing inside our housemaid's bag. I had an confrontation with her immediately and she denied and cried saying she never touched the phone nor had any idea how it got there. I noticed my daughter calling her theif repeatedly so I told her to stop and go to her room. I checked the indoor camera before continuing the argument and saw my daughter place her iphone inside our housemaid's bag, I was livid. I apologized to the housemaid and gave her the rest of the day off. I then showed the video to my daughter and she was absolutely speechless. I said what she did was immoral and straight up offensive to tamper with that poor woman's livelihood over a petty party she couldn't go to. I told her she was grounded and will have to spend the night in the backyard (she is a germaphobe) but she cried begging me to not make her sleep with the dirt, insects and hot temp. I refused to discuss it or I'd make it 2 nights. My wife said I should go easy on her but I said calling people filthy and accusing them of stealing wasn't ok in fact it was the absolute worst, I then went through with my punishment. \n\n\n**The reason I chose this punishment was because of the fact that my daughter says she is a germaphobe and use this as excuse to insult others hygiene and appearance, our backyard has dirt and bugs in it and this kind of things get her uncomfortable but other than that the backyard is 100% safe**\n\n\n\n\n\n**Question/ why doesn't she clean up and do house chores as punishment instead?**.\n\n\n**because I've already tried this punishment before and it didn't work because she deliberately stopped eating for days to get out of it, and ended up in the emergency department for low blood pressure**",

The issue is every single time we have an argument she will bring up I missed the birth. It happens almost every single time form serious arguments to what fastfood should we get. Today was my breaking point, we got into an argument about her wanting to change the daycare situation. She wants to change daycare to one closer to the home. I do drop off and she does pick up. The only one closer to our home is too expensive and we can not afford it.\n\nIn the middle of the argument she pulled out I wasn’t there for the birth again.

I asked my oldest friend to stand by my side and she was excited for me. But as time passed and the wedding drew closer her enthusiasm waned. When she was in town for my bachelorette, I asked if she wanted to meet my fiance ( we are long distance friends) and she showed no interest. That felt weird- the friend I’ve known the longest didn’t want to meet the man that I’m finally going to marry? Strange. Then the wedding- she messaged me saying she couldn’t make it due to a scheduling conflict with her kids school. I was devastated and hurt but I’d never want her to feel like I was making her choose between me and her kids. I made peace with the fact that my oldest friend wouldn’t be by my side on the most important day of my life. Fast forward 3 months and the wedding is 2 weeks away/ I haven’t heard anything from my friend and out of the blue she texts and asks me if she can still come to the wedding. Cue crash out! I am already stressed and it is too late to adjust plans! I kindly told her she was always welcome and she could join as a guest but I didn’t have the capacity to re plan or accommodate for her. She messaged back that she’s sorry she ruined our friendship and wished me the best. \nAm I the asshole for not accommodating my friends changed plans 2 weeks out from my wedding? ",

      "body": "We were on the phone talking and playing a video game. After a short time, she said she was \"choking\" because of her asthma and that it was hard for her to speak. This was around 12–1 AM. She wanted me to stay on the call, so I did. Every 5–10 minutes I asked if she was okay, and each time she answered with a shaky voice saying “I don’t know.” I was really worried and suggested she wake her mom up, since her mom would know what to do. She said no, that her mom would yell at her and that this always happens. So I just stayed on the call.\n\nA few minutes later, I called her name and got no response. Just before that, I had heard coughing. I called her name again... nothing. I assumed the worst and started yelling her name. Still nothing. I called her phone to make it ring... no answer. I called one of her friends and explained what was happening. Her friend also became worried and tried to reach someone in the house. All of this happened within 10 minutes.\n\nI started calling the ambulance for the city she was in (we were in different cities at the time). The line was busy multiple times. After 15 minutes, I called my local ambulance to see if they could connect me to hers. They couldn’t, but told me to call 112. I did, and they transferred me. The dispatcher asked for her number so they could try to reach her. 13 minutes later they called me back to get her address. I stayed on the line.\n\nThen, her friend said she reached another friend who had her mom’s number. That person called her mom repeatedly until she woke up, she went into her room. Turns out my girlfriend had just fallen asleep and was okay.\n\nI felt huge relief. But then I had to figure out how to cancel the ambulance. I called and let them know. The dispatcher said, in a rushed voice, “Alright sir, just next time think well before we alarm everyone possible,” and hung up. Now I feel really guilty and embarrassed.\n\n**I think I might be the asshole because I triggered a big emergency response when, in the end, nothing was wrong. It may have wasted emergency resources.** But from my perspective at the time, I genuinely believed she might be in serious danger.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "Throwaway because my sister knows my reddit and I don't want this causing drama\n\nYesterday, My sister hosted a family dinner at her house. It was one of those \"just because\" dinners, no special occasion. My sister is a great cook and she made tons of food for that one night. My daughter, was on her second plate by the end of the night. Once she finished she asked if she could get another one. I said yes. But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said \"Another plate?\". My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look.\n\nMy daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate.\n\nI turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked? \n\nMy daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house.\n\nI told my sister she was being ridiculous and somehow our voices got loud enough where my mom started to hear us in the small corner, she came over and started telling me she agreed with my sister and it was rude for my daughter to eat that many plates. I started to get fed up when they began telling me I wasn't teaching her proper manners, so I left. Then of course they began texting my phone saying how it was rude to leave in the middle of our conversation. I don't think I was the A-hole at all for leaving because I wasn't going to stay in a place where I felt disrespected. But i'm not sure about the plate thing. \n\nSo am I the A-hole for assuming my daughter could get another plate?",

      "body": "I (F20) have been in a bakery course since September and every Wednesday we have an 8 hour hands on class. The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. \n\nLast week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. \n\nIt's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. \n\nSo today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. \n\nNow he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first. \n\nAITA for reporting my teacher over a joke?\n\nEdit: I thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the things I was feeling.

      "title": "AITA for Kicking Out My Roommate's Twin Sister After She Took Over My Room?",
      "body": "So I (29M), a second-generation Indo-Canadian, recently moved to the US for work. Things were going great until I ended up in a house with these two ethnically Polish twins from the UK, Kasia and Nadia (both 27F). Kasia’s in med school, and Nadia just passed the bar and is practicing law. Both of them are smart, driven, and, yeah, they’re pretty attractive—not that it matters, but they do love their yoga pants. Just setting the scene here.\n\nAnyway, Kasia was my original roommate. We met through a mutual friend, and it seemed like a perfect setup. We split the rent 50/50, and I took the larger bedroom because I work from home at times and needed the space. Everything was peachy until Nadia, the twin from hell, decided to move in after she broke up with her boyfriend. Without even asking me, mind you!\n\nSuddenly, Nadia was crashing on our couch every night. She was loud, always on the phone, and had a knack for using my stuff without asking. And let me tell you, nothing prepares you for finding your 8 AM Zoom meeting shirt on your roommate’s sister while she’s doing yoga in the living room.\n\nBut here’s where things got heated: Kasia had to go on a two-week clinical rotation in another city, and she told Nadia she could take over her room. Fine, whatever, that was between them. But then, Nadia decided that my room was \"better for her mental health\" or some nonsense because of the \"natural light\" and \"feng shui.\" So she started moving her stuff into MY room while I was at work.\n\nWhen I got home and saw this, I nearly lost it. My bed, my desk, my PS5—all of it was shoved into the smaller bedroom, and Nadia had turned my room into her own little law office/yoga studio combo. Kasia, from wherever she was doing her rotation, thought this was all just “a big misunderstanding” and that we could “sort it out when she got back.”\n\nSo, in my infinite wisdom (or maybe stupidity, you decide), I told Nadia she had 24 hours to get out. When she didn’t budge, I started moving her stuff back into the living room. She flipped out, threatening to sue me for “unlawful eviction,” which I’m pretty sure isn’t a thing when you’re not even on the lease.\n\nThe next morning, she was gone—along with Kasia’s expensive espresso machine, my favorite hoodie, and all the toilet paper in the house. Kasia is furious at me for \"mishandling the situation\" and says I’ve caused a rift between them. Nadia, now back at her ex's place, is telling everyone I’m an a-hole who \"discriminates against Eastern Europeans\"\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for kicking out my roommate’s twin sister after she took over my room?",

      "body": "So, this a throwback and the people involved besides my husband are no longer a part of my life at all. But therapy is weird and while working through something else entirely the memory of this situation popped out from wherever it was laying dormant in my brain and hasn't gone away since. So, I shall ask you, oh dear citizens of Reddit, AITA here or was the pastor out of pocket?\n\nLet me set the scene: It is Christmas eve early 2000s. It is below freezing outside and snow is blowing lightly around. My husband and I are alone, but will be going to visit family the next day. We used to have our celebration on Christmas eve just us, then go to the big family event the next day. \n\nThere was a guy our pastor was helping out, around 20 years old. My spouse and I were early 20s as well. The only thing the pastor new for certain about us was we didn't have kids and we didn't have plans for Christmas eve that involved other people. Or maybe he didn't know the second part and just assumed? Unclear. \n\nAnyway, hubs and I went out for our annual Chinese food meal and to hang out looking at Christmas lights then planned to watch a movie or something at home. While out at dinner husband got a call from our pastor telling him that he'd sent the guy we didn't know (we'll call him Brian) to our house because we weren't doing anything and thought we should be kind and share our Christmas eve with the man. Let me be so clear that this was never discussed prior. \n\nWell, he sent the guy to our house on a dang bicycle in freezing temperatures and was irate when we didn't leave our food to go visit with Brian. We were lectured about Christian love and how we were not being good Christians by not inviting Brian along. What? \n\nSo, we eventually go home, Brian is on our couch (presumably he was told to just go in? We lived way out in the country so the doors weren't locked.) I'm shaking with anger. I tersely said goodnight and went to bed because I was not dealing with a relative stranger when my little introverted heart had been promised one night of peace out of the week of chaos.  All of this was reported back to the pastor by Brian who was so hurt and put out by us not being there when he arrived. \n\nI thought nothing of it honestly until months later I asked the pastor for a letter of recommendation which he willingly gave only to find out he wrote horrible things about my character and my uncharitable nature. Based, I can only assume, on that event since I served regularly at the church and helped quite a lot of people if I'm being honest. Which this pastor would have known. So. Am I the Asshole? ",

She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers.

After explaining, my wife is on my side. \n\nAITA for defending my daughter's \"real\" vagina?",

      "title": "AITA for serving my sister's husband dinner using toy utensils?",
      "body": "\n\nI, m17, moved in with  you sister after my parents kicked me out for coming out (another story) they said I'll be here temporarily til I get back to \"normal\" which I don't think I will, lol. But uh...anyways, so I moved in with my sister and her husband about a month ago. FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.\n\n\nThey fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing. I went inside my room but the argument didn't stop, now he's expecting an apology for me for meddling in his marriage and pulling this crappy stunt on him. I could be TA for this but I was just so mad for my sister and also sick and tired of being sick and tired of the nightly fighting over dinner.",

      "title": "AITA for lying about being pregnant to my family to protect my husband?",
      "body": "**I'm really sorry I didn't add this before. This post has really blown up but anyway...**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Content warning: Transphobia\\*\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband is a transgender man and we've always wanted to start a family together. I have a huge fear of pregnancy so he offered to carry the baby. It was an insane process. He had to stop taking testosterone for a long time but he was amazing throughout the whole process and I did everything in my power to help him feel more comfortable.\n\nNone of my family know that he is transgender (homophobic, transphobic, all the phobics), but our friends know. He posted an ultrasound to his private instagram, not knowing that my sister follows him on a burner account. Well, she saw the photo and told my whole family. They were FURIOUS that I wouldn't tell them (our plan was to say we adopted). They assumed I was the one pregnant and blew up on me, so I just let it go and rolled with the lie because I wasn't going to out my husband.\n\nThe first couple of months I'd let them visit, eventually I'd start eating big meals and purposely bloating myself to the point of discomfort so I looked pregnant. They'd remark around the 6 month mark that I was remarkably small but I just played it off. Eventually I couldn't lie any longer, so I looked for every excuse in the book to not see my family. I turned down the offers of baby showers, gender reveal parties, anything that would require us seeing each other. Luckily my family live an hour away and we all live busy lifestyles, so them randomly visiting wasn't an issue. The one time they did pop in unexpectedly, we were out of the house. If they Facetimed, I made a point to be in bed feeling horribly sick so I couldn't give a \"bump update\". I lied my ass off and they just thought I had a rough pregnancy.\n\nMy husband gave birth a year ago and went straight back on the testosterone, and now we're happy as ever. My family have met our daughter and they adore her.\n\nA week ago, after an argument between myself and a friend, said friend decided to out my husband by messaging my family and included proof. They did it by adding everybody to a group chat, posting screenshots and basically the whole story, then saying \"I'll leave you all to discuss\", then they left the chat and blocked me and my husband.\n\nIn a transphobic rage, my mother raced to my home and all but beat my front door down. It wasn't pretty. I had to call the cops. I've been disowned, but that hasn't stopped the daily calls and texts coming from my parents, aunts, uncles, siblings etc., leaving nasty transphobic slurs on my voicemail and other hateful crap.\n\nI ended up crying to my friend yesterday who told me that I should have been honest with my family, as it would've saved me a lot of heart ache. That, or said we miscarried and then adopted later. I'm not happy that things played out the way they did. I just feel so sad now. Maybe it was wrong to lie to my family, but I feel like I had no choice.\n\n**Edit, because I figured I'd put this in the main text:**\n\nMy husband has always encouraged me to maintain a relationship with my family however it was mostly for his sake. Personally, I mentally checked out years ago. But when they met him, they welcomed him with open arms and treated him like a son. Yes, it was conditional on him being presumed cisgender, however we never intended for them to find out. He felt a familial love that he's never had from his own family before, which is why I kept my relationship with my parents at his request. If it weren't for him, I most likely would have cut them off a long time ago. I'm sad that this has happened, but most of that sadness is for my husband rather than for me.\n\nAlso the friend in this story who outed him is obviously no longer a friend, and never will be again. The other friend who said I should've told the truth is on thin ice.\n\n**Another edit: Y'all are making us ugly cry. Thank you so much for the support.**",

      "body": "Hey all, I’m feeling a little conflicted and wondering if I might be an asshole. Here's what happened.\n\nI have this buddy I see every now and then, mostly in group settings. My girlfriend recently became friends with his fiancée, so the four of us will occasionally hang out, maybe once every six months. We’re friends, but not super close unless we’re on a group trip or happen to run into each other.\n\nAbout a month ago, he texted me saying something like, \"Hey, not sure we have room for the wedding, but you should come to the bachelor party. Should be around 400 bucks a head.\" I said \"I'm in!\"\n\nA month goes by. The trip is getting close and I still haven’t heard any details or a single email. In the meantime, work has gotten hectic and I’ve been feeling pretty burnt out with work travel and making time for my girlfriend between her work travel.\n\nA WEEK out I finally get an email with the plan from who I think is his best man. Turns out it’s actually $600 a head for lodging alone, and we’ll be skiing for two days. So it’s 200 per night for the Airbnb, plus two days of skiing, and once you add in food, drinks, gas, everything else, this is shaping up to be over $1000 for a Thursday to Sunday trip.\n\nIf this were a close friend, I’d stay committed in a heartbeat. But with everything going on, and considering we barely made the cut for the wedding, it feels like a big lift for someone I dont see often. Additionally, I will be traveling out of the country for work and driving down 4 hours to the cabin the day after returning back to the state.. I don’t make a ton of money to afford a trip like this, and probably won’t know anyone else on the trip. (yes \"international travel\" with \"dont make much\" sounds funny, but thats just how my industry is).\n\nI ended up texting him saying I can’t afford it and won’t be attending but that I am sorry and really excited to celebrate him during his wedding.. He hasn’t responded yet. Now I feel like an asshole. AITA?\n\nTLDR:  friend I’m not incredbily close with invited me to his bachelor party. I thought it would be around 400 dollars, but a week out it turns out to be closer to a thousand. I bailed and now I feel bad.",

      "title": "AITA for not putting my MIL’s Maiden name in my child’s name. ",
      "body": "My fiancé (24m) and I (24f) are expecting our first child in December of this year. We don’t know the gender yet so we were picking names for both a boy and a girl. We’ve fallen in love with names already. My fiancé has his father’s last name, and that name is on his birth certificate. While his mother has a completely different last name. She has been hellbent on getting us to make the last name of our child her maiden name which neither of us have. So in my head it just doesn’t make sense. She has been very manipulative in the past with various things to the point where we have given in to just get her to leave us alone about things. This time around she proceeded to guilt trip us on why we won’t give the child her last name. She proceeded to throw the “I raised you he didn’t” card and even said she was going to go to the court to change my fiancés last name which I found hilarious seeing he’s a grown adult. Now mind you MIL has 4 sons, two of which have her maiden name as her last name and all four children are straight and have potential to bare children of their own in the future. Im trying to convince my fiancé not to give in to even hyphenating her last name and keeping it just his current last name to help set early boundaries on raising this child. But MIL has it so deep in his mind that he has to please her and that she’s entitled to make these decisions because she raised him. Not to mention she had demanded to be at my gender ultrasound instead of waiting for the reveal we have planned at our baby shower. So I’m just curious if ITA because I want our child to have his or her father’s last name and not their grandmothers. \n\nUPDATE: My fiancé and I have talked and we have agreed to give the baby his last name as I will be marrying him and taking the last name anyway. Boundaries will be HEAVILY set with MIL and appointments will be kept private between the two of us. I thank all of you who have validated my feelings and who have given advice as this all has helped make us realize and make him realize that this is a creepy power control thing on her end. We only want the best for baby and we need to lay the law now or it will never happen. \n\nUPDATE 2: My SO has talked to his mother and made it clear to her that the name will be what we wanted. Not what she wants. She has seemed to let go of the subject as of right now but is still a bit upset about it. She hasn’t answered his most recent text message regarding his reasoning so it’s unsure how much of it she has let go or come to terms with. \n\nAs for the 20 week ultrasound, I am having my OBGYN write a statement saying that only me and the father of the baby are welcome into the appointment at the time to avoid immediate conflict. After that steps will be in place to avoid letting anyone in any of my appointments aside from my SO. Thank you again for all your advice. ",

      "body": "I'm not sure whether I'm TA here. My husband is a professor and he often hosts colleagues at our house; I usually know and like them so I don't mind this. My husband also will do 90% of the work to make this happen (room prep, food, etc.). He also co-supervises students from out of town/out of the country. He's a very kind and generous guy -- and super-extroverted -- and likes to host them at the house and says hotels are so sterile and impersonal. Just some context to set the stage.  I am generally ok with this but asked if we can skip hosting students because it's more stressful and awkward because I don't know them. Either way, we agreed that he needs to run it by me before he commits, and then add to our shared calendar (we have A LOT going on), so we can coordinate. \n\nWell he either forgot to ask me about this upcoming student, or I forgot he asked (honestly, either is possible); either way it was also not on the calendar. In addition, we currently have been hosting out of town friends for the last 10 days, sandwiched between travel (me, before they arrived; both of us after the \"student\" leaves). So it will be 2.5 weeks that we will not have the house to ourselves when all is said and done. AITA for asking for this student to stay at a hotel? He says he'd already said it was ok and feels bad reneging. \n\nWhy I might be TA: I asked my husband to have one of his students stay at a hotel even though he already committed to hosting them at our house. It means a lot to him to be able to host students and colleagues like this, and that's how he has been treated his entire career, including when he did his master's and doctorate. But I'm exhausted and tired of hosting.   \n",

We're talking about making it a home for both of us.\n\nBut as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. \n\nWhen his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. \n\nWhen I am bothered, she's like \"I was just helping with chores\" etc. He says I should just let her because she has \"a lot of nervous energy\" \n\nOne thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little \"affirmation\" post it note on my monitor saying \"I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things\" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. \n\nAnyway, she made a comment to about my ego... \n\nBut as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of \"affirmations\" to hide.\n\nSome were:\n\nMedicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!\n\nKitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!\n\nWork desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! \n\nWalk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!\n\n\nThere were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them. \n\nNext time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. \n\nI went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. \n\nHe asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? \n\nHe said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.\n\nI was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit\"\n\nHe asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.\n\nHe said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!\n\nAITA for the note prank?",

She has a large following on instagram and TikTok showing off her bags. (I monitor her activities and help her post she does not even have access to the accounts on her her own) \n\nMy sister Stevie just started dating this man who has a daughter Zoey who is 15. Stevie has had financial issues due to her lifestyle habits. I believe her boyfriend is in the same boat but both are recovering. However Zoey has a  birthday coming up and Stevie wanted me to give her one of my daughter’s bags that she saw on instagram because it is Zoey’s  favorite character and the bag has been discontinued. She showed me the price on ebay it’s about $500 and Zoey really wants that bag. The thing is it was one of my daughter’s first bags and she love that character. It’s also my daughter’s property and it’s not like I can just give away her things. \n\nI told her I would split the cost of a new bag for Zoey if that’s what my sister wanted since she’s short of funds but my sister insisted she should give Zoey the rare bag and put Zoey on my daughter TikTok.

For those accusing me of making this up, I wish I was. I can’t say I blame you though, if I read a post this insane I would probably think the same thing. Unfortunately, This is something very real that I am dealing with and I was simply looking for some guidance.\n\n\nTo give some backstory, I (19F, white) have been living with my college roommate (19F, Hispanic) for the past two years. Last year, our dorm building only had community bathrooms, so I was completely unaware of her bathroom habits as we did not share this space.\n\nFast forward to the current school year, we now have our own apartment where the two of us share a bathroom. After about a week and a half of living together, I started to notice a foul odor coming from our bathroom. I spent hours scrubbing the shower, sink, toilet, floor, and counters, but the smell did not go away. I convinced myself that it must have been the sink releasing some trapped gas from the pipes or something. I submitted a work order to have the drain looked at and called it a day. \n\nAnother week goes by and the smell is almost unbearable. Maintenance still hasn’t come, so I open the cupboard underneath the sink to try and have a look for myself. When I open the door, my nose is violated by an odor one can only describe as a porta-potty that has been sitting in full sun on the hottest day in July. I now realize where the stench is coming from as my eyes fall onto the trash can underneath the sink that is completely overflown with brown and yellow stained toilet paper. I walk directly over to my roommate’s bedroom and confront her about this. \n\nI ask why she has been throwing her used toilet paper into our trash can rather than flushing it down the toilet. She tells me that it is “Mexican culture” and I wouldn’t understand. I have never heard of this in my life so I continue to question her about it. She tells me that everyone in Mexico throws their used toilet paper in the trash because the septic systems there aren’t designed to withstand toilet paper being flushed down them. \n\nI believe myself to be a very understanding person but this is just completely bizarre to me because my roommate has lived in the USA her entire life and has never even been to Mexico. I asked her if she wouldn’t mind flushing her toilet paper in our apartment due to the horrific stench that had built up over the first few weeks. She tells me that this is a part of her culture and she doesn’t appreciate the fact that I am not respecting it. She has been acting extremely standoffish and rude towards me since our conversation and I don’t know what do do. AITA for asking her to flush her toilet paper?",

He is always boasting and bragging. This has been going on for 3 weeks. \n\nSo, some examples are as followed: on his days off he wants the house to be radio silent. If our 4 year old wants to play, he tells her to stick to her bedroom because he needs peace and quiet after \"working so hard\". If I make our daughter lunch, he will immediately say \"wheres mine?\" He asks me to grab him things damn near constant all hours of the night. He expects nightly back rubs but if I ask he will scoff at me and say \"I worked all day\" (even if I had as well). He expects meals that HE likes made every night, regardless if me or our daughter like the meal or not. He also now acts like he has full say over the money because he \"makes more\". \n\nLast night was the tip of the iceberg for me. Before this I let a lot of shit slide because it was a recent promotion and hell, hes excited! So, I get it. But last night around like 11pm (I was in bed scrolling through my phone) he comes into the bedroom, lays down and says \"babe you should go make me some ice cream. I want the chocolate drizzle on it. And oh, dont forget the cashews!\" Then he starts scrolling through his phone. I ignore it because I feel at this point I was going to snap. He then shook my leg and said \"Did you hear me?\" \n\nSo I responded with \"Yeah. I did hear you and no. Go make it yourself. You were literally just out there. Your sense of fucking entitlement is way out of line. Do shit for yourself.\" He became offended and instantly, like fucking clock work, said \"But I worked all fucking day!\" So I snapped back with \"Yeah, I did too! In fact, I worked 12 hours to your 8. Like I said, do shit for yourself.\" \n\nHe is now saying that he is not acting entitled and that I was just taking my bad day out on him and that everything I said makes him feel unappreciated. \n\nAITA? Did I push it too far?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding after she secretly dated and got engaged to my ex-fiancé?",
      "body": "Alright Reddit, buckle up, because this is a rollercoaster.\n\nI (28F) was engaged to my ex-fiancé \"Mike\" (30M) for two years. We were together for five years in total and were supposed to get married last summer. About three months before our wedding, I found out that he had been cheating on me with someone else. It was devastating, and I called off the wedding immediately. Mike moved away shortly after we broke up, and I thought that was the end of it. I was heartbroken, but I slowly started to move on with my life. Fast forward to last month, I get a call from my younger sister \"Lily\" (25F) saying she has exciting news and wants me to come over to our parents' house for dinner to share it. When I arrived, Lily and my parents were all smiles, and she drops the bombshell: she’s engaged. To Mike. My head was spinning. I felt like I was going to pass out. Lily and Mike had been secretly dating for the past year, and now they were engaged. My parents had known about it for months but decided to keep it from me to \"protect my feelings.\" They actually thought I'd be happy for them eventually. Lily tried to justify it by saying she and Mike fell in love after our breakup and that their relationship is meant to be. She insisted that they didn't start dating until after we were officially over, but I felt betrayed on so many levels. I told them all that I wanted nothing to do with their wedding and stormed out. Since then, my parents and Lily have been bombarding me with calls and texts, calling me selfish and saying I'm overreacting. They claim that true love is rare and I should be supportive of Lily's happiness. Now, the wedding is in a few months, and the pressure is on. My parents have even threatened to cut me off financially if I don't attend. Some friends think I should go to keep the peace and show I'm over it, while others are appalled and say I have every right to be angry and to stay away. To add insult to injury, Lily recently asked if I would be her maid of honor, claiming she wants to mend our relationship. This request has left me torn—I don't want to ruin our family dynamic further, but I can't shake the hurt and betrayal I feel.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding after she secretly dated and got engaged to my ex-fiancé?\n\n**THE LONG AWAITED UPDATE**   \nHey Reddit, it’s been a while. I want to thank everyone for their support after my last post. I didn’t update sooner because, well… things have been *crazy*. I needed some time to process everything before coming back here to share what happened.\n\nWell, Things have escalated beyond anything I ever thought possible. After reading your comments and reflecting on everything, I realized how truly messed up this situation is. Thank you to everyone who pointed out the timeline. I started digging deeper, and sure enough, the truth I was trying to avoid smacked me right in the face.\n\nI confronted Lily about the cheating, and she cracked under pressure. After dancing around the question, she finally admitted that she and Mike *did* start seeing each other while I was still engaged to him. Their relationship started *before* Mike and I broke up. She tried to justify it by saying that it \"just happened\" and that they couldn’t help falling in love. To make it even worse, she had the audacity to blame me for it! According to her, I was \"too busy with wedding plans\" and \"neglecting\" Mike, which apparently *pushed him* into her arms.\n\nI was furious, and when I told my parents, they *still* defended Lily! My mom literally said, \"People make mistakes. You just need to move on and support your sister.\" My dad? He didn’t even blink. He just kept going on about how family is more important and that I need to be the bigger person. I couldn't believe that after everything, they were still siding with her.\n\nThen, things got worse. My dad called me the next day and said if I didn’t attend the wedding, he’d \"reconsider\" paying for my grad school next year. Can you imagine? They’re actually using financial threats to force me to go to this circus of a wedding. It’s not even about keeping the peace anymore—it’s about controlling me.\n\nSo, after a lot of sleepless nights and a whole lot of anger, I’ve made my decision. I *am* going to the wedding.\n\nBut I’m not going just to sit there and pretend everything’s fine. I’ve decided that if they want me there so badly, I’m going to make sure everyone knows the truth. I’ve already told a few of my close friends and cousins what happened, and they’re as disgusted as I am. They’re ready to back me up when the time comes.\n\nSo, the wedding happened. And to say it didn’t go as planned would be an understatement.\n\nI showed up, and everything seemed picture-perfect from the outside. Everyone was smiling, laughing, and celebrating as if nothing was wrong. My parents were beaming, and Lily and Mike acted like they were the stars of some fairytale romance. I felt like I was suffocating in that room full of people who either didn’t know the truth or were too willing to look the other way.\n\nThe reception was where things really went down. As maid of honor (yes, they *still* made me stand up there), I had my moment during the toast. I had prepared a short, sweet speech to get everyone comfortable. But after I finished, I couldn’t keep quiet any longer. I looked right at Lily and Mike and said, \"I hope everyone here knows that this isn't the fairytale wedding they think it is.\" There was an audible gasp, and the room fell silent. I told the guests everything—how Mike cheated on me with my own sister, how they started seeing each other while Mike and I were still engaged, and how my parents helped cover it up.\n\nLily’s face went white. Mike tried to play it cool, but you could see the panic in his eyes. My parents? I didn’t even look at them because I was *done*. After I finished, I put the microphone down and walked right out. Some of my cousins followed me, and we all left together.\n\nWhat followed was pure chaos. People started whispering, and it wasn’t long before the truth spread around like wildfire. Some family members were shocked, others disgusted. My phone was blowing up with texts and calls from my parents, but I ignored every single one.\n\nThe aftermath has been... intense, to say the least. My parents are furious with me, saying I ruined the wedding and humiliated Lily and Mike. Lily tried to play the victim, of course, but at this point, no one’s buying it. Some family members have taken her side, but surprisingly, a lot of people are backing me up. They were appalled that my parents and sister could treat me like this and think I’d just roll over and take it.\n\nAs for Mike and Lily? They’re married now, but from what I’ve heard through the grapevine, their relationship is already on rocky ground. Apparently, the fallout from my speech created a lot of tension, and some of their friends and family have distanced themselves from them. I can’t say I’m surprised. A marriage built on lies and betrayal isn’t exactly a solid foundation.\n\nAs for me? I’ve gone low-contact with my family. I’m focusing on myself and rebuilding my life without their toxic influence. I’m working on becoming financially independent, and though it's been challenging, it feels liberating to be out from under their thumb.\n\nIt’s been a wild ride, but I don’t regret a single thing. They expected me to stay quiet, but I refused to let them control the narrative. I stood up for myself, and I’ll always be proud of that.\n\nSo, that’s the story. Thanks again to everyone who supported me through this. Your comments helped me see things clearly, and I’m grateful for that. If anything, this experience has taught me that sometimes, the only way to heal is to expose the truth—no matter how messy it gets.",

I was in college at the time and I had a huge student refund. \n\nShe asked me for $1,500 to settle the debt. She said thank you and we never talked about it again. I didn’t want my granny to be homeless after all. That was about 8 years ago. Fast forward to today and I’m now the owner of a house in the heart of Atlanta. Prime real estate If I do say so myself. I plan on moving in at the end of the month before doing some light cleaning and renovation. Enter my cousin and her kids. \n\nShe is upset with me because I got the house. She said because I don’t have any kids I should give her the house because I’m her eyes I got the house for free. I thought she was crazy but a lot of our family is on her side. Stating that it’s hard out here for a single mother. They told me I can buy a house one day because I am a able bodied young man. It will be harder for her because she has two kids. I’m like she chose to have those kids and that isn’t my problem. Everyone is calling me selfish and hell maybe I am but my grandmother wanted me to have the house. I’m I the Asshole",

      "title": "AITA for letting my nephew to call me mom?",
      "body": "Awhile back, my brother married a woman who had an 11 year old son named \"Billy\". A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.\n\nI asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.\n\nWhen he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said \"To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance.\" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.\n\nMy SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?\n\nEdited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. \n\nAlso, I just want to thank everyone who left such sweet comments. I've been so choked up reading them all.",

      "body": "I met my father in September of last year. I (16m) was 15 at the time, had recently lost my mom to cervical cancer and had found out that my grandparents and two of my aunts did not want to keep taking care of me. And instead of letting me go to my aunt out of state, they contacted the man who wanted nothing to do with me before and involved a social worker so I would need to go to him instead of the aunt I actually knew and who did want me.\n\nBecause a social worker was involved she made the effort to put me with my biological father over my aunt. I pleaded with her to let me live with my aunt and my aunt pleaded for this as well but we were denied. I was told a biological parent will always get custody over an aunt or uncle who has no legal rights to the child. Especially when my original guardians (my grandparents) sent me to my father instead. So in October, 3.5 weeks after I met him for the first time, I moved to another state to live with my father and his family.\n\nFor those who will tell me I was lied to or whatever, my father has admitted he knew about me but he was disgusted and embarrassed by his promiscuous ways in the past and for having pre-marital sex and he decided to start over. He said his wife was thankfully \"very open-minded\" and was happy for me to live with them and have a relationship with them despite my origins... which have fuck all to do with me.\n\nMy father and his wife are very religious. I'm not. I was raised by an atheist mom, had a mostly atheist family and I have no interest in joining or taking part in anything religious. This is a serious point of contention with my father and his family who try taking me to church and try to set it up so I will join their church and get baptized. I have refused. I have also said I want to live with my aunt. But that gets denied. I do talk to her via dms and video calls but it's not the same. She did try to petition for custody but the different states thing added complications, especially when a social worker is still actively involved.\n\nThings got way more tense recently because two of my father's other kids were questioning me on why I don't pray and stuff like that and I told them I didn't believe, they tried to get me involved with their church stuff and I said no. They got upset and tried to do all this converting stuff and they're only middle schoolers for fuck sake. My father tried telling me I shouldn't shoot it down so quickly and he told me to give it a try and I said no. Then his wife decided to get her say and she told me I should be grateful for a chance to be saved and I'm being very stubborn and should show them respect as my parents to let them guide me into religion. I told her they are not my parents, they are randos I'm forced to live with and I will never take part in their religion ever and they need to accept that because I don't believe in God or anything. They didn't like my \"closed mindedness\" and they were pissed I spoke to them \"with such finality\".\n\nAITA?",

I could have an adult conversation with her about this, but I'd rather wait to see if she says it again, and be a little hyperbolic and try to make her feel guilty.\n\nMy wife’s aunt Sally has twice told me that my parents don’t love me. I don’t think she meant to be hurtful, but I really hated hearing that. \n\nThe first time, she was upset with me, and lecturing me about how to be a better husband. She presented it as a way to make allowances for me and relate to me. It was basically, “I know what it’s like to grow up with parents who don’t give you unconditional love, but you’re an adult now, and you need to decide what type of person you’re going to be.”\n\nThe second time, she meant it as a compliment. A few months before my son was born, she said “I know you’re going to be a loving father, even though you didn’t get the love you needed growing up.” \n\nI have a complicated relationship with my father. He can be very obnoxious. Things have been tense between us for the past two years. It’s a very sensitive topic for me. I have difficulty talking about it even with close friends. If you were trying to hurt my feelings, it would be hard to find a better vulnerability to poke. \n\nI'm not good at thinking on my feet. I didn't know how to respond the first two times. If she says it again, I want to say “I know you're trying to be nice, but that's one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me.”\n\nI realize that there’s a right way and a wrong way to address this, and my way is definitely somewhere in the middle. I'm just trying to find out which side of the asshole line it falls on. A well-adjusted adult would either have a heart-to-heart with Sally, about the lingering feelings from what she said, or just let it go and accept that she made a mistake. On the other end of the spectrum, some people would address this with yelling and name-calling.\n\nSally and I got along very well for several years before this happened. Now, I'm uneasy about sharing anything personal with her. I make chitchat with her, but I don't like to get into deep conversations, because I don't like the idea of her knowing about sensitive topics.\n\nI want her to feel ashamed of herself. I'm certainly being at least a little bit of an asshole by weaponizing her compassion against her. I just want to know if I'm going too far.\n",

I was really excited to have them over because I thought I successfully got friends, despite me having a bit of an accent that I was insecure about. \n\nMy grandmother was home, and she does not speak a word of English. At the beginning, when I introduced her to my friends, I got a weird vibe because I saw them laughing among themselves at her broken English. I wasn't sure at the moment, but it felt off and I shook it off.\n\nLater, when my mother called us down to dinner, one of them made a joke about the smell. My grandmother was really happy that I got friends and she cooked some traditional food for them. My friends sat down and didn't really eat the food. They picked at it and one of them asked if we can get pizza instead. My grandmother came and asked me if my friends didn't like the food, because they only picked at it. I didn't really have the heart to tell her what they were saying. I felt really left out because my friends were laughing with each other and saying how much they like pizza, pasta, and other things, obviously mocking the food that my grandmother had made. I was really frustrated and I told them to not be rude. They just giggled and said nothing more.\n\nThe third incident was later that night. I was getting ready in the bathroom and they were in my room. I over heard them laughing and saying why my grandmother was wearing a costume in the house, as she was wearing a traditional dress from Pakistan. I also heard them whisper that she smelled bad. That was when I got really angery and I came out of the bathroom and exclaimed loudly for them to shut up. \n\nMy friends all told me that I was going too far and they were just joking. However, I don't want them to disrespect me, my country, and my grandmother in my own house. I told them to get out of my house. They were upset and left, driving away. It was around 11 O'Clock at Night. \n\nI don't really know what to do now because they were my only friends and I feel like kicking them out was too much. I tried texting them afterwards and they blocked me. I don't really know how I'm going to face them in school next Monday. My Grandmother was very sad at what happened and I don't have courage to tell her why I removed them from the house. I feel bad because I telled them to leave really late at night, but they do have Driving Licenses. ",

I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. \n\nI've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. \n\nOn boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. \n\nThe next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. \n\nI told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. \n\nSo I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. \n\nI think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. \n\nAITA?\n\nI think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",

      "body": "Long story short, i lived in an LA apartment with two acquaintances for over a year. In California, after a one-year lease ends, it automatically converts to month-to-month. I moved out for a job opportunity in another state and found a replacement tenant, who has now been living there for a year and a half. this person has never been officially added to the lease. \n\nSince the beginning of the year I've asked for my name off this lease. I've been asking for this switch up for a while now, and while the current setup doesn't affect their living situation, it does impact my ability to move forward with home ownership, because on paper I'm still legally responsible for a lease i no linger live under. \n\nThe issue? One of the remaining original tenants says the landlord is \"finicky\" and they're worried rocking the boat could lead to everyone being evicted or sell the house. They want to wait until the new year- this has been said before and the goalposts keep moving. Meanwhile, they insist it doesnt inconvenience me to keep things as is. ",

      "body": "I (42F) have a (15F) daughter named Mary. She’s been a bit curvier than other girls since she hit puberty at age 10. It’s been a huge source of stress for her and there’s been multiple incidents where she attempts some crazy diet (in 6th grade while at a sleepaway camp for music she didn’t eat for a week except for a few granola bars). She’s at a point now where she’s a bit more accepting of her body and isn’t going to do anything reckless, but we have to be extra careful to not mention weight stuff around her because it makes her upset. \n\nI really want to emphasize that she doesn’t eat anything more than what other girls her age eat, and if anything she eats less. She’s had doctors walk in the room and tell her that she’s “really big for her age” and girls at school saying similar. My daughter is at a loss of what to do, she exercises and eats healthy.\n\nAnyways, my mother pointed out at dinner 2 days ago that she was “tubby” and she suggested that I put her on a pill and sign her up for weight watchers or a similar program. Ever since then she’s been texting me with “resources” and I got so mad at her refusal to stop that I told her that she should check out some of those resources because she wasn’t looking so skinny herself. She told me to fuck off and then she blocked me, and left me wondering if I’m the AH in this situation?",

      "body": "Throwaway.\n\nMy brother, “Paul,” and I are not close at all. We have very different worldviews and have incompatible personalities. I can tolerate him, but I would never consider him a friend. He’s been married to “Lisa,” for one or two years now and they have a beautiful daughter together.\n\nMy girlfriend, “Amy,” and I were invited to celebrate my niece's first birthday. Most of the family was invited, and it would be the first time I would have seen them all together (I only see my family once or twice a year, with a few exceptions.) \n\nAmy and I arrived a little earlier than we were supposed to and instead of waiting in the car, we decided to go in. The first thing I noticed is how calm my brother seemed to be in contrast to Lisa, who was frantically running up and down. When he saw Amy, he immediately handed the baby over to her and got a beer to sit down and watch TV. Lisa was clearly struggling, and he was content with a beer and Netflix. \n\nI don’t want to be rude and maybe this was a one-time thing but it bothered me how uninvolved he was. He handed Amy a baby with a full diaper with vomit on its clothes.\n\nEventually Amy, Lisa and I finished everything. The house was clean, the food was ready, and Lisa looked ready to host a big gathering. We all paid zero attention to Paul. \n\nWhen my family arrived, I thought everything was going well. I avoided Paul and enjoyed speaking to my family. After we had sat down to eat, Paul approached me, drunk, thanking me for helping Lisa. I did not want to be around him for long and moved out of his way.\n\nHe was very persistent.\n\nI was ignoring him but he started talking about Amy. “Protect Amy like a “real” man.” or “You’ve got a great woman by your side.” You know what, whatever. It was slightly odd and mildly uncomfortable, but I was able to brush it away. Amy was trying to sober him up a little bit before the cake-cutting so she was “selectively hearing.” \n\nWe tried to get him to stop talking and drink water. However, he had a lot to say about Lisa. He was complaining about how pregnancy “ruined” Lisa’s body and how a baby ruined his life. Amy and I kept looking at each other awkwardly and we were soon going to leave him be. \n\nWe didn’t leave the conversation soon enough.\n\nHe was complaining to be about his sex life, or lack thereof,  and commenting on how desperately he wanted to have sex with someone “fit like Amy.” \n\nThis made the both of us extremely uncomfortable. Amy left, quickly apologising to Lisa. I told him that he was a “disgusting, gross man who needs some fucking help,” before I left. \n\nApparently, this made him super upset and he started wailing at the party. Paul told everyone that the reason he was crying was because of my words to him. He got over it quickly, but a few people told me I was wrong to shame a father on his child’s birthday. I could have probably left without making a statement. AITA?",

      "body": "My husband's brother and his wife are expecting a baby together. This is their first. My husband and I have four kids so we've been there, done that and we're both happy with our kids names. For the sake of the post BILs wife is going to be Emma.\n\nSo Emma came to me a few weeks ago and asked me how my husband and I figured out names for our kids because she and BIL haven't listed the name name yet for their baby. She said they've made a few lists already but there's never one name overlapping. She said given we seemed to find our names easily and we're still happy, she felt I was a good person to ask.\n\nI decided to help her without going into \"name your baby this\" or \"use this to get a baby name\" and instead I told her some steps my husband and I took. 1) Write a list of top names, top 10, 20, 50 whatever and choose the names off each other's list that are absolutely no, never going to happen and accept that and don't hold a grudge over it 2) Discuss what your priority is in a name. For us it was a name that fit among peers (not too old, not too weird) but where they would still be the only \\[name\\] in the class. 3) Try to have fun with it both individually and together 4) Take breaks if you feel yourself getting stressed or frustrated.\n\nEmma took it all in and even made some notes on her phone while we talked. She thanked me for the words of wisdom. Then she went to BIL and all seemed fine. Until he found out I had given advice. He told me I had no business interfering and told my husband I should mind my business. My husband stood up for me and said Emma had asked and I didn't interfere, I didn't try to talk them into a name, I just gave some tips on how they could work together better.\n\nEmma apologized to me for BIL getting so angry. BIL said I should at least apologize before we put this to bed. He said I did overstep with my advice. My husband said BIL is being unreasonable.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my son that the fact that his sister was happier to see her cousin was his fault?",
      "body": "Background: I (42M) have a son “Jack” (22M) and a daughter “Cassie” (7F) from two different marriages. I had Jack with my first wife “Penelope” who passed away when Jack was 9. This hit both of us hard. I thought Penelope and I were going to be together forever. It took me a long time to be ready to date again, which I started doing when Jack was 14. He wasn’t happy about it.\n\nI met my first girlfriend, my current wife, “Sara” through work. We dated for a few months before birth control failed and Sara became pregnant. Because of that, our relationship progressed very fast. She moved in with Jack and I by the time she was four months pregnant. \n\nJack was understandably very upset, but bother Sara and I wanted our child to grow up in a two parent household. Unfortunately, due to lack of space, we also had to move out of the apartment I shared with my late wife. Jack was put in therapy to help him adjust. \n\nHowever, Jack and I did luck out a bit with Sara. Sara made it a point to have prominent memorabilia of Penelope because of her awful step-mother all but erased Sara’s mother. \n\nAfter Cassie (my daughter) was born, Jack wanted nothing to do with her, which was understandable, but upsetting. \n\nHowever, Cassie’s maternal cousin “Will” (18M)  adored her from day one, and happily stepped into that brother role. Frequent hangouts, played with her dolls, etc. He even has a matching (i think) hello-kitty necklace with her, and uses it as his good luck charm for his sport. \n\nThis was the first year both Jack and Will left for college. Jack messed around during highschool and had crappy grades and no scholarships. While I would be able to pay, I refused to pay 50k/year+ for him to screw around. So, he went to community college for two years and this year transferred to a good school. Will was an A student as well as an excellent athlete, and got an almost full ride to a far away school. \n\nThankfully, both boys were able to come home for Thanksgiving. Jack came home first. She greeted him without much fanfare, but was still happy he was home. This was very different from how she greeted Will. She waited at my SIL’s house for him, made a huge glittery sign, and started bawling her eyes out when she saw him. \n\nMy sister-in-law posted the video of them reuniting on Facebook, and Jack saw the video and was very upset at the difference in Cassie’s “welcome home” enthusiasm. After listening to this for the fifth time, I snapped at him and told him these were the consequences of his actions, i.e. doing nothing to make a bond with his sister for the past seven years. He got pissed and stormed off to his room. Since then my former in-laws have been ringing my phone off the hook yelling at me and demanding I reprimand my daughter for her lack of enthusiasm at his return. Cassie doesn’t know why, but she can tell her brother is upset at her and it is affecting her. Will is pissed that Jack is making Cassie upset. I don’t know what to do. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not helping my younger sister just because she has Cancer?",
      "body": "Okay so before the story I want to give background. Our dad is pacific islander, and our mom is just white. My sister (14) and I (17) were both born in the US. Our parents divorced when I was six I think. However I continued to live my dad until I was 11, whereas my sister stayed with my mom. I live with my mom now because my dad wanted to move back to the islands, but I didn't want to leave my friends. However I know much of my family who still do live on the islands, and keep in touch with my 'roots' I guess. This is mostly thanks to my dad. My sister doesn't. Okay so onto the story.\n\nAbout four months ago my sister was diagnosed with Sarcoma which is like a kind of bone/tissue cancer. She's had to go through a lot of procedures and spend a lot of time at the hospital, and I've spent a lot of it with her and helping her, and while I don't mind helping her, when she did get diagnosed my Mom expected me to drop literally everything to be there to help her. Meaning if she's at the hospital, I'm at the hospital. If she's undergoing a surgery or 'stressful procedure' I have to stop everything I'm doing (including school) and sit in the waiting room as support.\n\nBut all that I could handle and it was annoying but whatever. However recently the doctors finally decided they wanted to do Chemo, and my sisters hair has begun to fall out. She shaved it, but is extremely upset about it, because she really loved her hair. The other day my mom suggested that I shave my own hair so a wig can be made out of it for her. For reference my hair goes down to below my butt. However the thing is you're only supposed to cut your hair when a family member dies, and it's a tradition my entire family (dad's side) upholds. And to be frank, I like my hair and have no desire to shave it, as I have been growing it out since I was a kid.\n\nI explained this to both my sister and my mom, but both are instant that I should do it, and that a tradition like that is meaningless, especially since my sister might die anyways. I told them no. They've both asked several times more, and my sister even begging. I once again reiterated why I wouldn't, and that asking me too was insulting.\n\nNow my sister is upset and saying that I obviously don't actually care that she's struggling and aren't being understanding. However I've bent over backwards for her, so the fact she's going so far hurts. But she's also never asked me of anything like this before and is really upset, so I just don't know, AITA??",

My MIL has insisted everyday from returning that we(my husband and myself) should buy my children a tablet as well (3 and 2).

I asked him why he took the money and he said his mom would kept insisting the kids needed ipads. We are not very strict on screen time but we try to be. We let them watch tv but it is always a struggle with them fighting on whose turn it is. My view is that I don’t want my children to be stuck on their iPads all day and not engaging with family or play at all.

I stay with my children at home but she is the only person we have to care for them in case of errands or date nights. Honestly I do not know if we should accept the offer or return the money.

I have made this known previously and it has even been a running joke with them about how I am terrified of the restaurant (which is fine! I can take a joke!) but it is just not making me feel very good that in order to celebrate us they offered to take us somewhere they know we don't like.\n\nThe restaurant is fine. It's not even bad. My problem with it is that it's in my hometown and it's a spot where, without fail, my parents will see their friends. Their friends will come up to the table and say hi and stay and talk a bit. I don't dislike these people and gladly socialize with them in other contexts but I just hate having to sit through these interactions while I'm at dinner.

I am not a particularly socially anxious person but I just really dislike this for some reason.\n\nWhen I was invited I tried to make a lighthearted joke about it being \"my favorite\" and my parents said they don't want to drive very far.

I feel the only way to keep this from being an issue is to go along with it and \"celebrate\" somewhere I don't even want to be just to please my parents.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. \n\nI'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the \"harmless, funny token fat guy\" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. \n\nLast night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \n\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?\" \n\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \n\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. \n\nWas I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?\n\nEdit: I guess I’ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can’t find out why.\n\nTo answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn’t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",

Ryan just said “Yes” and went about his way.\n\nAfter this, Joe asked me why I laughed and I said I thought he was making a little joke about being picky with responses. Joe said it’s not picky, explaining that “I told him to do something, it’s a command from his manager, not a request. By saying sure, he is treating it like it’s a request and like he has discretion on his part. By saying yes, he’s showing he understands he needs to follow orders.” He then told me that it was rude for me to laugh at what he said in front of our employee.\n\nI sort of see where he’s coming from in that “sure” sounds more casual, but it seems super uptight on his part to react that way.

      "body": "My husband and I had to be somewhere for our older child so we asked my mil if she could watch our 3 month old son for a few hours. She said of course. Unfortunately when we went to drop him off, she wasn’t home and one of my husband’s sisters Jane (21) was instead. Apparently my mil wasn’t going to be home for a bit so she (Jane) agreed to watch our son for some time. \n\nI immediately said no because well Jane believes that babies don’t feel anything. She thinks that they cry for no reason and we shouldn’t respond to their cries ever for whatever reason. And that not responding won’t have any effect on them. She thinks that anything we do to babies during this period of their lives will have absolutely 0 effect on them in the future. She will often call them mindless too.\n\nMy husband called his mom and we politely explained our concerns and then hung up because we were extremely busy already (and now we had to find another babysitter as well). \n\nI figured that was it until Jane came over extremely upset and in tears insisting that she’s not a bad person and that she would never do anything to hurt any kid. She then accused me of “discriminating” against her because she doesn’t want/have kids like everyone else in the family. I told her straight up that I don’t give a crap if she wants kids of her own, but I don’t like her thoughts on how to care for babies specifically. Instead of trying to understand me, she doubled down and said that her way of dealing with babies makes sense and that I’m wrong and I’m just extremely sensitive in nature so of course I don’t get it. \n\nShe kept arguing with me about how to take care of my baby so I just asked her to leave and she blew up on me. My husband even told her to calm down and that it’s not like we’re preventing her from seeing our kids all together but she just went “fuck you and your dumb ass kids” and left. Which… okay… ? \n\nBut my mil is really annoyed with me because Jane is still very upset and I’m just wondering if I’m the AH? Like I don’t think I am especially since no one lets her babysit for the same reasons but I’m the first person to actually say no to her face and tell her why instead of making up an excuse… and perhaps I was too harsh… ",

I get along well enough with her new husband, he's a cool guy in general, treats me and my mother well. He also has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, as he's been married and divorced his ex.

My cousin asked if I am going to call my mom's new husband dad. I obviously said no. I already had a dad and was a fully grown woman by the time he came into my mother's life. \n\nAfter that comment, my mother and her sister pulled me aside, and started yelling at me to stop bringing up my father in front of her new husband because... he's jealous? Of a dead man? His ex is alive and they see each other every other weekend to pass the kid but he's jealous of a dead man? I basically told them to get off me. That I do not do it deliberately but my father had been my father for 20 years and naturally I bring him up sometimes in passing. Especially to my younger cousin who was only 7 when my dad passed away and barely remembers him.\n\nMy aunt went into a whole tangent how \"my dad was important to me but is not important to anybody else anymore and I should let go and move on instead of talking about him because everyone else is.\" That, in turn, made me cry and I didn't speak to either of them for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA for bringing up my dad sometimes?

I used to own of variety of jewelry sets but due to unfortunate circumstances most of them had to go so I could afford rent after I lost my job. My husband never got lucky to land a job since 2013. Thankfully now I have a stable job that gets us by from month to month.\n\n\nI also kept one set of jewelry which is the most valuable wether momentarily and/or sentimentally since it's part of family herilom. The set includes a pair of earings - a bracelet and - a necklace. All gold material and again they are worth decent amount of money. My BIL has been with then gilfriend for 10 years and they recently got married. It was a huge deal for the family. My husband wanted to get them a decent wedding gift and tried borrowing money from friends and neighbors but got turned down. He kept stressing out about it for weeks and just the other day (the wedding was days prior and the groom and bride are off to their honeymoon) I discovered that my jewelry set was gone. I freaked after my husband nonchantly said he gifted it to his brother's wife as a wedding gift. I was fuming I asked how could he and he replied that he had no money and nothing of value to give the newly weds and besides that that set has been sitting in the closet since July, 2019 and I never wore any piece of it so he figured I'd forgotten about it but he said he'll figure a way to pay me or get me a similar one once he starts working but I very loudly told him andolutely not and gave him 3 days, just 3 days to return the set or I'll stop paying for everything in the apartment. He looked puzzled like he couldn't believe I was serious. He said he doesn't want to cause an issue but I said it's already there  and if he doesn't want issues all he has to do is contact his brother or his wife and retrieve the set or go get it himself. He tried to twist the argument and offer the same solutions as mentioned above but I refused I said I just want my set back and he has 3 days only. He kept talking about how tasteless and disrespectful it'd be for him to retreive a wedding gift and said this will damage his relationship with his brother and family and also how impossible it was to retreive the set in 3 days when the couple are on their honeymoon in another country.\n\nAITA for this? He said I was financially abusing him by threatening to stop paying for anything knowing I'm the breadwinner. Also he refused to give me their new contact info to retreive the set myself.",

I approached nicely, advised I was worried because it is 90 degrees and I did not want him to fall or get overheated. He said he was fine. I then overstepped my bounds and asked if he had permission to cut the renters lawn. He said no. Then I really opened my mouth and advised if he starts cutting the landlord’s property for free, they will come to expect it all year. I received a glare. I told him thank you for trying to help, I know he means well, but please ask permission before doing work on other peoples properties. We take a lot of pride in our yard and enjoy doing it ourselves. Elderly neighbor told me he does not want our neighborhood going downhill, he will cut it if he wants to, and walked back into his house. \n\nI know I said too much. I hurt his pride.

However, due to him moving abroad and conflicts over an inheritance, we no longer talk these days. \n\nRecently, I've been receiving calls from various local and overseas relatives asking for financial help for my cousin. He has defaulted on his house payments and is more than six months behind on mortgage and loan repayments because his wife [native Chinese] convinced him to buy a house in Shanghai. He [ABC, by the way] had a good job in what should have been a stable company, but the virus f'ed them hard, and he has never recovered. Apparently, it seems he got laid off eight months ago. \n\nWhen we were still talking, and he told me that he was going to buy this ludicrously expensive 2.8 million RMB house (about 400k USD) that was basically a concrete box. I told him he was insane and would regret it for many reasons, but particularly because he would never actually own the place due to Chinese laws. Now, four years later, he still owes nearly 2 million RMB on his mortgage since his payments have only been covering the interest, and near an additional 1 million RMB in loans for the decorations used to make that naked concrete box a place you can live in. \n\nI am a teacher in the US, and I don't earn enough money to own my own damn house, so how am I supposed to give someone else money to pay off theirs when I warned them this would come back to bite them HARD? In the Chinese real estate market, you are always just one bad day or one conman away from losing three generations of savings. This house was so expensive (for him) that it took up 70% of his monthly income just to pay the interest on the mortgage. \n\nNow, I am being harassed for his stupidity to help him out of this hole because I let on that I had a decent savings account. It's not house money, but I want to buy a new new car; something nice for once and not just new to me. Even my biological family is giving me grief about this. But I don't want to help. \n\nWill I be the asshole if I don't help them?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments and reassurance, Asian family guilt is a crazy WMD on it's own. Yea so they are trying get everyone to \"donate\" to cousin. All of this is because one auntie overheard me talking about getting a new car and they all started circling like vultures, and the guilt has been raining for days. ",

      "body": "I (28F) got married two weeks ago and I am still getting backlash from what happened so I'm here to see if I really am in the wrong.\n\n\n\nMy husband and I decided to have a child free white wedding where the guests are in white. I personally don't like to wear white because I always feel that no matter what I'm doing something always manages to get me dirty. So, my dress was not white but blue.\n\n\n\nThis all started when I decided who would be in my bridal party. I chose two friends from middle school, one from high school, my 16-yr old niece and my cousin. Since I was having a child free wedding, I didn't want anyone under the age of 18 but my whole family knows my niece is my one exception.\n\n\n\nWhen we went to the dress shop to pick out dresses, I informed my bridesmaids they would be in black to match the groomsman. Everyone was on board with the color, and we found a dress that fit everyone, and the top could be adjusted for comfort. Everything was going great until my cousin asked why my niece was getting the same dress, so I told her she was a bridesmaid. Cousin said she assumed she was there for a flower girl dress since I'm not inviting anyone under 18 and if I needed another bridesmaid her daughter could do it. I told cousin no, and her daughter is a guest. Things got awkward but we were done so we left, and I took my niece out and explained she was a bridesmaid and that wasn't changing.\n\n\n\nEverything was going great after that until bridal dress shopping. At that point I had done alot of research to find dress style I liked and who had the color I wanted or could get it. I went to the appointment with my bridesmaids, my parents, and in-laws. Everything was fine but I didn't like anything I picked until my mom found a dress, I didn't think I would like but ended up being the one and they could get it in my color. We were all happy until my cousin said something that made me snap. She said that I should pick a dress that made me look prettier and not as fat. I blacked out and said a bunch of things I shouldn't have then kicked her out of the bridal party and the wedding. A few days later my aunt who I love, and respect called to ask for my cousin to be invited as a guest. I did feel guilty about the things I said so I said yes. \n\n\n\nFast forward to the wedding and it was my turn to walk out and the first thing, I see out the corner of my eye is GOLD. My cousin sat in a middle row on the aisle in a gold strapless dress. [(how she looked)](https://images.beautifulhalo.com/images/392x588/201912/W/ladies-sexy-fashion-gold-metallic-ruched-strapless-midi-bodycon-bandeau-dress-for-nightclub_1576438558652.jpg) I wanted to cry but we continued on and once we were finished, I told my wedding planner to have her kicked out and kept away. \n\n\n\nA few think she could have stayed but others think she should have followed the dress code. My aunt thinks I could have asked her to leave instead of having security throw her out and embarrass her.\n\n\n\nAITAH for throwing my cousin out for wearing gold not white?",

      "title": "AITAH for giving my stepmom and sister fake ashes of my dog?",
      "body": "So some context… Last week, my dog of 13 years passed away in his sleep. Up until this past year, he has lived with me since he was a puppy. He was staying with my dad for the time being because my apartment changed its pet policy and no longer allowed certain breeds and I could no longer keep him at my place. I had already renewed my lease for the following year so my dad offered to keep him until I could move somewhere else that allowed dogs again and I was so grateful.\nWhen he passed, I immediately went to get him from my dad’s place. But when I arrived, my stepmom and little sister were already digging a hole in the backyard to bury him. I was blindsided and really upset. I’ve always known I wanted him cremated — I even talked about it before — because I wanted to keep his ashes with me. And honestly, I didn’t want him buried in the backyard of a rental house that doesn’t even belong to anyone in our family. It took a serious argument to convince them to let me take him. I even paid out of pocket for the cremation service because no one else offered to help or seemed supportive of that decision. This is where I might be the asshole…\nFast forward to yesterday: I got home from work to find a package on my doorstep from my stepmom. Inside were two miniature urns and a note asking for “their share” of my dog’s ashes — as if it was some group project. I was so pissed off, I took fireplace ashes from my boyfriend’s place, filled the urns, and planned to give those to them instead. Now I’m feeling kind of guilty. But at the same time, I’m still really upset. They tried to bury him without telling me, in a yard that isn’t even ours, and they made me fight just to do what I wanted for MY dog — and now they want part of him like it’s nothing.\nSo… AITA for not wanting to share his ashes and for giving them fake ones instead?",

      "body": "I have been my 12 year old niece's legal guardian for a couple months. \n\nMy niece is a tiny kid. She's about 4 feet tall and maybe 40 pounds (we're trying to get her to gain some weight but she has an autoimmune condition that is making it difficult. She's currently in 4th grade and she's still one of the shortest in her class. \n\nShe has a high backed booster seat in my car. She's never cared until a couple days ago. I took family medical leave and used almost all of my PTO when I took her in but now I have to go back to work. I was debating between getting her a babysitter or having her go to the after school daycare but I heard that a teacher's daughter nannies for a girl in my niece's class and she gave me a great price so we're trying this out. \n\nI explained the booster seat to the nanny and she told me that the other girl also has a booster seat, just a backless one. I thought about it but I'm really not comfortable with my niece being in a backless booster. She barely meets the weight requirement for a booster seat and we've already had so many health issues since she's moved in with me that I need her to be as safe as possible right now.\n\nI took her with me to get her booster seat and to drop it off with her babysitter and when she saw that we were getting a high back seat, she lost it. She said all of the other kids are going to be mean to her and I'm treating her like a baby and she doesn't want a babysitter if she needs a booster seat. \n\nI tried reassuring her that nobody in her class is going to know, except for the other girl the babysitter will be watching (and I've volunteered in this class enough to know that this girl is the sweetest thing and won't say anything). Still nothing I say is making her feel better and she's threatening to refuse to get in the car with the babysitter tomorrow. ",

      "body": "I'm currently a PhD student and also work. Hence, I'm busy. I made some changes to my project right before my confirmation seminar which I'm only mentioning because my husband was well aware of my increased workload and pending deadline.\n\nI told him confirmation was rapidly approaching and he asked if he could come to the presentation. I told him I wasn't sure but would ask. Then the university sent out my presentation details email with a zoom link. I forwarded it straight to him. A few days go by and I realised he hadn't mentioned it. I asked if he read the email and he said no. I asked him to read it. A few more days go by, I asked him again to please read it. \n\nAt this stage I realised that not only had he not read the email but he hadn't bothered to enquire about the presentation. Unfortunately this is fairly normal for him. He doesn't often enquire about much about me, ask me many questions about my day etc and I admit I'm tired of being ignored. I could have 'reminded' him the day of the presentation but to be honest I didn't want to. I wanted him to care enough to either ask or read the email. This is where I might be the asshole.\n\nPresentation day comes and I present and pass. He has no idea and still doesn't ask. After a g of days I decided to finally mention it to him. He things I'm the asshole for not reminding him. I think he's the asshole for not caring enough to ask.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to add: for those asking, I never email him so this is not a case of constant emails that could be overlooked. I forwarded him the email from the university that was entitled something like 'Confirmation presentation'. That email would stand out like crazy from any other emails he receives. I forwarded it as I was at work when it came in and my job isn't one where I can then also text/call to tell him it was there. I'm in Australia so confirmation occurs one year into our work as students and is partially open attendance. ",

      "body": "I (34F) and my partner (37M) were out at a social event with his daughter (13F) and my parents. My partner drank heavily, including Jack Daniel's — something we both had agreed he would avoid due to his tendency to pick fights while drinking it.\n\nAfter waiting around 35–40 minutes for him to sort a ride home, I went to ask him for the house keys so I could arrange our own transport. I believe I asked politely and lightheartedly, even telling him he was free to stay out if he wanted.\n\nIn response, he screamed \"Get f*cked\" in my face in front of others, including my family and his daughter, then stormed out. Later, when I told him how hurtful and disrespectful his outburst was, he blamed me for being rude and claimed I \"deserved\" his response, saying that’s the only way I’d \"learn.\" He maintained this stance the next day while sober.\n\nI am now questioning whether I’m in the wrong for standing my ground, even though I truly don’t believe I was disrespectful.\n\nKey points:\n\n*He broke a mutual agreement not to drink Jack Daniel’s.\n*I made a reasonable request after waiting a long time.\n*His reaction was public, aggressive, and inappropriate.\n*He has shown no remorse and believes his behavior was justified.\n\n\n*UPDATE* \nOh my gosh I didn’t expect such a big response. \nI am reading all of your comments\nThank you all so much, I truly appreciate you all.\n\nTo those of you who are recovering, your doing amazing! I’m so incredibly proud of you all xo\n\n\n*We aren’t married but have been together for 6 years now. \nMy partner actually has two children, both from a previous marriage which ended due to his ex-wife’s infidelity.\nHis son was away camping the night this took place.\nSo, not my children but are treated like my own. \n\n*I do have my own set of house keys, but when we go out together we normally only take one set… I won’t be doing that again.\n\n*Honestly, my partner is generally a good guy, especially when sober. I know that’s hard to believe haha \n\n*He does tend to act a bit \"big-headed\" when around his mates from our local soccer club. They were also there when the incident occurred, but that doesn’t excuse his behavior. \n\nLike I’ve stated, I truly don’t think I was or meant to be disrespectful in the incident and I would have apologised if my partner had addressed the issue calmly. \n\nI will be speaking to him about all of this and what needs to change if our relationship is going to continue. \nIt’s currently school holidays here in Australia, so finding quite time is a little tricky atm. \n",

      "title": "WIBTA for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?",
      "body": "My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.\n\nThe theft: \n\nOn Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband’s aunt & uncle’s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.\n\nWell..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.\n\nMy kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.\n\nDue to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.\n\nI’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. \n\nI feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.\n\nI mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don’t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. \n\nAlso - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.\n\n\n\n***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy me pads?",
      "body": "Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account. \n\nI (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven’t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn’t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would’ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn’t really expecting that. \n\nI asked him why. He said that he didn’t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn’t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn’t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn’t want anyone to see him with the pads because they’d think he was a “tr***y”. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn’t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I’ve been thinking that maybe I might’ve pushed it too far.\n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?\n\n*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I’m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we’ll see how it goes*\n\n**UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn’t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn’t feel like he had to, and that I could’ve “held it in” and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can’t “hold in” menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could’ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn’t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. \n\nI asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he’d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn’t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I’d need help is if I was a “cripple”. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn’t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. \n\nI can’t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can’t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month’s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I’m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I’m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all.",

      "body": "I 32F used to be poor but now I'm probably considered rich. Most of my friends from high school and before are still pretty poor (I make like 10x their income). I was having brunch with my friend Linda (32f) and she was complaining about the crazy inflation and how currently it's so hard to make ends meet.\n\nI said \"yeah I know right? I remember when horizon milk was 2$/half gal but now they were 7$ for half gallons now\"\n\nand she said I was too privileged to complain about cost of milk when she still struggles to pay 2$ for an entire gallon of milk of whatever was on generic brand.\n\nI said sorry I was just trying to agree with her. The rest of brunch was a bit tense.\n\nI also just in general have been having a hard time connecting with Linda and my other older childhood friends because we have different struggles. They seem to forget that just because I have more money, it doesn't mean I don't have struggles or I don't see their issues. I forget to filter what I say and it can rub them the wrong way even with good intention. I never thought I would become this privileged rich snob, but maybe I have without realizing it?\n\nBackground info on horizon: \n\nWhen we were kids, her family qualified for food stamps/gov aids, and mine didn't (back then we were trying to immigrate/obtain citizenship and were told if we got aid, we would be denied). Sometimes she would have horizon milk if they had a bit extra for food stamp. We would drink horizon as if it was pure luxury. We had joked once we become rich, we would be able to afford horizon milk. When I got my first (fastfood) job, I bought her a carton of horizon and joked how we were so rich at 16 to have our own horizon. But now we're in such different places in life, it's no longer a good inside joke.",

      "body": "For context I’m a black woman and my husband is white. I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don’t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. \n\nI used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I’ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don’t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. \n\nFirst night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it’s the little comments when I get into bed. Like “are we doing the slave tonight?” Or “should I help you into bed grandma?” Little things like that. I’ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn’t like it and my hope was that he’d get used to it by now. \n\nLast night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn’t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he’d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn’t tell me where. He wouldn’t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman. \n\nHe got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven’t talked much about it but there’s this air of awkwardness. The only times he mentioned it was this morning when he said that we should look into counseling for our “race issues” and that I made him feel really racist and I didn’t think about it that way. \n\nI thought he was upset because I yelled at him but I didn’t think it was the statement itself (granted I probably should not have brought race into it but I wanted to illustrate a point.) Now he’s suggesting couples counseling to get through our “race issues”? I don’t think it was that serious and I don’t want to go through all that. AITA?",

      "body": "For context, I was living in a shared apartment with two other people. When I arrived, I paid a one-month deposit, and the roommate who welcomed me told me I would receive it as soon as the next roommate occupied my room. When I arrived, I explained to her that I was there for five months, then I had to leave the country. She told me it was okay, but that when I left, she would be traveling, so I would have to find a new roommate. I accepted. Two months after I moved in, this roommate talked with the landlord, who explained to her that our apartment wasn't legal and that the authorities wanted to demolish some walls, including those in my bedroom. So I was at risk of losing my room. Months passed, and I was planning to move out. So I needed to find a roommate to take it over. But no one was interested in my room because, as I explained, the authorities were supposed to tear down the walls soon. Which, in my opinion, is completely understandable; the situation is very precarious. I spoke to my roommate about it. She said it was okay. A day ago, she sent me this message: \"And there's one last thing I wanted to talk to you about! You didn't get back the 5000 deposit you paid in February, because there wasn't a new roommate to give it back to you... I finally managed to find someone (despite the problems of potential work to be done...) but it's only going to arrive in August, so the month of July, for the moment it's Lily and I who paid together... so I was wondering if you would agree to your deposit being used to cover the month of July where we didn't have a new roommate when you left??”\n\nAm I the asshole for disagreeing with this and wanting my deposit back ?\n",

      "body": "So for background, my best friend has gotten into going to these Spartan races. He and a small group of his friends have started going to local ones but recently heard about one in another state they wanted to go to and compete in, but they didn't have anywhere to stay. So they asked me if they could borrow my truck and trailer (I have a tow behind camper) for the weekend. I said no, I wasn't comfortable with them taking my truck and trailer but that I'd drive them and the camper to their event. We made the three hour trip and set everything up in the area where the race was taking place the next day. \n\nI have a habit of leaving my keys on a hook next to the door to my bedroom in my camper. Remember this. \nCome nightfall, I went to take a phone call outside and ended up wandering around the grounds for over an hour. When I got back to the camper, the door was locked, and I was told by my best friend's older friend through the window that there wasn't enough room for me in MY trailer. So I reached for my keys to unlock the door, but realized I had left them inside the camper on the hook in my room. So I called my best friend from outside and all I was told was \"sorry bro, nothing I can do\". So I ended up sleeping in my truck that night, which I had fortunately left unlocked by accident.\n\nTheir race began at 8 am, and at 7, they came meandering out of the trailer and woke me up. No apology, by the way. \n\nSo while they were in their race, I hooked my truck back up to the trailer, closed and locked everything, and waited until just after they finished and had started walking back to the trailer (think really wide open field). When I saw them coming, I started the truck and drove off the property. With them chasing behind. I made the three hour trip back home declining call after call. When I finally got home, I finally took my best friend's call. He started yelling at me saying \"why would you do this? We have no way home now\". I just said sorry, you shouldn't have made me sleep in my truck after I did you this solid. \n\nHe told me that there were better ways to handle this than by leaving them in an unfamiliar city with no way home. I think he ended up calling his dad to come and get them. \n\nIs he right? Was there a better way to handle this? I felt justified until he said that. I am kinda doubting my decision now. \nAm I the asshole?",

      "body": "Sorry for the rant. TLDR; Me and my sister have never gotten along so I don’t want her at my wedding.\n\nI am getting married to the most amazing person. I’m extremely excited and couldn’t be happier.\n\nHowever once we started talking logistics and planning it became obvious that I (M30) do not want my older sister (F39) to attend.\n\nWe have always had a strained relationship. In childhood the age gap made it difficult for us to bond. My earliest memories of her are dodging things being thrown at me, screaming, and once while being babysat I was restrained with duct tape for being “irritating”. Once she moved out of the house we didn’t have a relationship. She spent her 20s going out and living life, like most of us do, but she didn’t came to thanksgiving/christmas/or other holidays and events for nearly 10 years. During that time my relationship with her was nearly nonexistent.\n\nA couple years ago she had an outburst during a family crisis. My father had an accident and it was touch and go. She was cruel to my mother in front of my father just before he went into surgery. This was the first time I cut her out. I didn’t speak to her for 2 years. This caused a strain on my parents who felt like they needed to choose sides.\n\nWe started to patch this up because she had a son but it was very difficult.\n\nMost recently, we had a disagreement in January at my grandfathers funeral. The night before some cousins got together to reminisce, I wasn’t up to it and had to decline. I didn’t think much of it considering I was already speaking with extended family and they understood. At the funeral she was sitting alone and my future wife said “You should go sit with her”. So I did. She was cold and ignored me while I played with my nephew until she broke the silence by saying “Your absence has been noticed”. I said nothing, got up and went back to my fiancé \n\nMy parents understand my sisters shortcomings, but she is a single mother now and needs support, and this division between my sister creates complications within the family. I feel bad putting my family in these circumstances but I refuse to tolerate my sisters toxic attitude. She is too old and had too many opportunities to grow, and I need to protect my peace. I’m starting a new chapter of my life but I feel guilty doing it like this.\n\nAm I The Asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for airing the mother of my grandchildren's dirty laundry in public?",
      "body": "My son, Tommy, died suddenly 6 years ago. He was recently divorced with two kids with his ex wife. The kids were 5 and 6 years old at the time of their dad's death. The kids and Tommy lived with us for a year at one point. Tommy's ex, Marla, was serving time after she stole from Tommy, from a friend of Tommy's and from my husband and myself. It delayed the divorce so they had been separated for more than two years and the separation started when Tommy learned Marla had cheated. We found out about the stealing after (and she stole from us after the separation). All in all Marla stole close to 35k between us all. Marla had recently been released and started back with 50/50 custody of the kids when Tommy died.\n\nAfter Tommy died Marla attempted to cut our family out of the lives of my grandchildren. My husband and I went to court and were awarded very generous grandparents visitation under grandparents rights of our state. Marla was furious. She tried to appeal but it was rejected twice. The relationship between us was not civil. So we kept it simply and only communicated times for pick up, dates were already specified. \n\nMarla remarried and now has additional children. Marla has asked a few times for us to include her other children. We ignore the requests. She has yelled at us when we pick up our grandchildren and does not care if they hear. We stay silent generally. My husband and myself have no wish to be a part of her other children's lives or to play any sort of role in her and her current husband's life. We have a relationship with our grandkids. They're close to us as we are them and they never ask to include their half siblings. So we keep things as they are.\n\nLast week my grandson had a school talent show that they wanted us to attend, so we did. Marla and her husband were there with their kids but we sat apart. When the kids finished and went back to their classrooms and as we were leaving, Marla approached and asked us to please think of her other kids and start acting like grandparents to them. We stayed civil and refused. Marla called us monsters. She said we were hideous monsters for turning our backs on her and her other kids just because she moved on after Tommy. She accused us of cruelty to children. She was very loud. I lost my temper and told her if she had wanted us in her life she wouldn't have cheated on our son and stolen from him, his friend and us and ended up going to prison. I told her we owed her nothing and we owed her children nothing and she needed to accept that our grandkids would always be our grandkids but she was no longer part of our family. Marla reacted to others hearing this and told me I had no right to air her dirty laundry publicly. That I should have kept that out of \"our mutual dispute\". \n\nAITA?",

      "body": "First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.\n\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\n\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.\n\nWhen I arrived for our first group hike, I learned \"Womens+\" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\n\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.\n\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. \n\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "My (16m) name is Nico and it's not short for anything. On my birth certificate it says Nico middle name last name. This is something a few people can't understand and some people call me Nicholas. Even teachers who see me on the class list as Nico and not Nicholas. \n\nI'm a foster kid. I've been in the system since I was 2. My mom is the only bio family I know but she's not able to take care of me. I see her twice a year through court ordered visits. But nobody in her family and I don't have anything to do with my paternal side.\n\nI've been with my current foster family for three years and I'm really happy with my foster parents and foster siblings. My foster parents actually want to help the kids they foster and their kids are cool with their parents fostering and don't bully me or others for stealing their families. So I hope I get to stay until I age out of the system.\n\nMy only problem is some of their extended family are snobs and they don't like calling me Nico. So they call me Nicholas even after being corrected a million times. My foster parents have explained that my name is actually Nico, not Nicholas. But the reply is always \"But Nico is short for Nicholas!\" A couple of the extended family have encouraged me to change my name because Nicholas sounds much more professional for an adult male, which I will be soon. I was like no thanks.\n\nMy foster parents told me I should ignore whenever someone calls me Nicholas now. Unless they're new and just assume. But I can ignore their family members who do it. So that's what I did. I've ignored them a handful of times now and it bothers them so much.\n\nYesterday it happened twice because one kept trying to call \"Nicholas\" over and I just didn't go. The other asked \"Nicholas\" to pass the potatoes at dinner and I kept eating and didn't pass anything. I was then called out for ignoring them and my foster parents said nobody knew who they were talking to because there was no Nicholas at the table. One of my foster sisters said she assumed it was her \"Nicole\" and they got confused and that's why she passed it instead.\n\nI was told I should be more open to the wisdom others offer with name suggestions and stop being rude by ignoring people. Even though my foster parents backed me up again. It made me feel a way because this really is my best foster experience and I don't want to piss off people in my foster family.\n\nSo AITA?",

Time has gone by and we've known each other for around 8 months now. She has this notion that anything she wants, I should freely just buy it for her. I've taken out to eat with her kids multiple times. I got her a car and taken her to several Airbnbs which have cost several thousands. She wants to get married, but she thinks she should be able to ask me for anything like microneedling and I should just give her the money to get it.\n\nI don't see that as a necessity, but she says she will always want to look beautiful and if I was her husband, I should be paying for it. She feels very uncomfortable asking me bc her ex never would do anything for her. Anything she wants from me, I get her at the store. I've gotten her kids diapers. I've never asked money back for any of these things. Well, after I got her daughter some pillows, she sent me 2 links to get her microneedling supplies. I told her, baby....that's too much right now and many people say not to get it, especially on Amazon. (terrible reviews on Amazon and $150 but over $1200 by a professional).\n\nShe said it's not asking for much. I got so offended since I do everything else for her. Got her a new bedframe bc hers broke. I get her things all the time. I just told her along the lines (very nicely) I couldn't do it right now since I need to save. She threw a tantrum and wouldn't talk to me for almost 2 days, until I told her I was very worried about immigration etc. She only responded, I'm ok. After that, the whole thing has changed our relationship. I feel taken for granted. I feel like she doesn't appreciate me. I told her this many times and she said she didn't do anything wrong. I told her, why can't you just apologize and understand how I feel? This led to days of arguing back and forth on texts. She told me I was playing the victim. I told her, when you get upset and cry and I hold you, never once did I say you were playing the victim.\n\nI told her, you aren't even remotely trying to care or be considerate of how I feel. I said, I don't like at all that you threw a tantrum over 1 thing I wouldn't get you. She said she thinks she's too demanding for me and said she won't hold me back to go find someone else I feel better with. I said, you're just going to let me go? She said, I'm not going to beg someone to stay with me who doesn't want to. I never tell her no. Am I the asshole for telling her no this time or expecting her to apologize?",

      "body": "I’m the youngest of three siblings. While I was away at college, my two older sisters offered my room to a friend of theirs who had been kicked out of their home. I initially understood and empathized with them wanting to help someone in need, but I was concerned about what would happen when I came back to visit. My parents were barely consulted—my dad only found out when the friend had already moved in, and my mom was told vaguely that it would be a “short time.”\n\nWhen I came home in December 2024, I didn’t have a stable place to sleep and had to move around different parts of the house. It didn’t feel like home, and I couldn’t use my room to relax, practice music (I’m a music major), or have any privacy.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I finally messaged my sisters to share how I felt. I acknowledged I should’ve spoken up sooner and maybe should’ve addressed their friend directly, but I also expressed that I felt overlooked. I suggested it would've made more sense for them to share space with their friend rather than offering my room—especially since one of them doesn’t even live in the house anymore. I said I felt like I was the only one being asked to sacrifice.\n\nMy older sister reacted harshly. She called me privileged and self-centered for expecting my room to remain mine while I’m away at college. She brought my mom into it, saying she supports me financially and does everything for me. I didn’t take the “privileged” label personally, but I found it hypocritical given that both my sisters rely heavily on my mom—one of them lives rent-free at our grandma’s, and the other gets constant support for her child.\n\nI called out that the decisions they made impacted others—especially me—and that they didn’t properly consider the consequences or communicate with our parents. When I pointed out valid concerns, my sister dismissed the whole issue, saying, “If it’s just about a room, do what you're gonna do,” then stopped responding.\n\nI later messaged their friend directly to work something out (no reply). I emphasized I wasn’t trying to kick her out, just wanted to feel considered. Now I’m back home, and I’ve heard she’s moved out. My sisters are clearly mad at me.\n\nTo me, this wasn’t “just about a room.” It felt like they prioritized someone else over their own family, and that hurt. I think everyone—including me—could’ve communicated better, and my parents could’ve been more assertive too. But I still feel valid in how I feel, and frustrated that expressing a difference of opinion led to personal attacks instead of mutual understanding.\n\nHappy to answer specific questions!",

We rely on each other to cover shifts when life happens, and I’ve always been covering for coworkers emergencies, staying late, you name it.

I rearranged my plans, covered for him, and later found out he just wanted to go to a concert. I was annoyed but let it slide. Last week, Jake asked me to swap shifts so he could attend a friend’s birthday party. I’d have to work a double shift on my only day off that week, which I’d planned to spend with my sister who’s visiting from out of town. I politely said no, explaining I had plans. Jake got upset, saying I was being selfish and that “we’re supposed to be a team.” He even brought it up in front of our manager, who didn’t take sides but seemed annoyed at the drama.\n\nAITA for refusing to swap shifts with Jake?",

      "body": "*(English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes. I know this situation might not sound dramatic, but I really need an outside perspective. I honestly don’t know if I’m being the asshole here.)*\n\nI’ve had a complicated relationship with food since early childhood. I’m not “just picky” - I have genuine sensory issues with taste, smell, and texture. If something feels off - even slightly different from what I expected - I can physically throw up. It’s not drama, it’s a real reaction. I’ve tried to explain this to my mom many, many times. But she doesn't understand why I can't just force myself to eat a dish even if I don't like it.\n\nI’m 18 now. I don’t expect anyone to feed me. I always say: *“If you want to bring me something, please ask first. And if nothing works - don’t worry, I’ll make something myself.”* But the response is always: *“I’m just worried about you!”*\n\nAnd I *do* appreciate the concern. I understand why she worries, especially since there are days when I really don’t eat much. But to her, “eating” means she has to physically see me eat what *she* gave me. And that’s how I ended up literally crying over a plate today.\n\nI was sitting quietly in my room when she suddenly brought me a plate of plain pasta with a little bit of cheese. I haven’t been able to eat pasta for years. During the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, I had to evacuate to Poland. I stayed with an aunt who cooked pasta nearly every single day for three months. Ever since then, I’ve had a strong aversion to it - partly because of the taste, and partly because of how emotionally low and trapped I felt back then. The only exception is if there’s a strong sauce, like bolognese. I’ve said this repeatedly.\n\nThe cheese she added was also something I hadn’t tried before. Cold, it was fine. But warmed up, it turned sour and unpleasant. I’ve told her so many times that the only cheese I reliably eat is a basic soft one - mild and creamy (I don't actually know what it's called in English, but I don't think it matters). But she keeps “experimenting.” And that would be okay - if I wasn’t expected to just eat whatever she brings anyway.\n\nThen she brought a salad. Again, I physically can’t eat it. I started to feel overwhelmed. Not just because of the food, but because once again, I felt completely unheard. And instead of understanding, I get *“You don’t appreciate the effort I put in.”* But it’s not about disrespect - it’s about being made to feel guilty for not eating something I’ve already explained I don’t like.  \n...",

      "body": "My (37f) husband (40m) has been working at his company for 10 years as a maintenance supervisor. About a year ago they hired Tabitha\\* to work in their accounting department. Since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.\n\nThis started when the heat went out in her office. My husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. She constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. \n\nLast year when we went to the company Christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. When he introduced us she just grinned at my and said \"look there's Peter,\" and grabbed his hand and walked away. When we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. She walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. I told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. I told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. \n\nThe past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. She recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. He gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. Multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. Last night at 2:00AM she called about her heat not working right. My husband said he would go over and look at it after work. I broke down. I told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. \n\nI told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. I told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. I told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and I am not comfortable with it. \n\nHe said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so I cried and told him that he can either to be married to me, or married to her, but I wasn't going to be the third wheel in my own marriage. \n\nHe says he does not have feelings for her and that I am overreacting to him just wanting to help a friend. I feel otherwise.\n\nAITA?",

She said that Claire was offended by my \"attention seeking behavior\" and that it was inappropriate to wear white to Claire's event. I left. \n\nI'm super confused.

      "body": "So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out.\n\nAmy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later.\n\nAbout 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, \"Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside?\" Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away.\n\nI forwarded the message to my other friends that were there, and most of them have left me on read so far, except one who responded with a thumbs down emoji, and another who hasn't seen it yet (as of this writing). The fact that no one's responding to me is making me worry that I might have been the asshole here.",

      "title": "AITA for not defending a girl I barely know after she was kicked out of the friend group for asking to be paid?",
      "body": "I (21f) have a group of 6 friends. 2 months ago, a new girl (Jane-22f) was introduced to the group.\n\nFor context, one thing our friend group does is ‘trade’ services. For example, I’ll do one of my friend’s nails for free and she’ll do my hair for free when I need it doing in the future. We generally try to keep the trades within the same price range. For example, if my hair costs £60, I’ll trade doing nails for £60-£70. Anything over £10 is usually paid on top of the free service (if my hair costs £60 and the nails are £100, my friend will pay me £40).\n\nTo be clear, there is ZERO obligation to do these trades and to my knowledge, no one has been pressured into one. It’s all about favours and doing nice things for your friends.\n\nAnyways, Jane joins the group 2ish months ago and immediately starts asking about my nails. At one point, she says she can’t afford to get hers done right now so I asked her if she wanted to do a trade. Jane makes her own t shirts/clothing/accessories. The nails I ended up doing on her cost £160. When it was my turn to pick clothes/accessories, I ended up leaving with about £70 worth. I told her not to worry about ‘paying’ me back with the £90. All in all, I thought it was a good experience and I got to talk to Jane one-on-one. It was fun.\n\nUntil Wednesday (the 11th of December). I get a text from Jane apologising and saying she realised she can’t afford to just ‘give away’ £70 worths of her stuff and she needs me to pay her asap or she needs the stuff back. At first, I’m really confused because I could not have been more clear about the how the trades work and I never forced her into one. I apologised back to her but said I didn't have some of the smaller items as I planned to gift them to my sister for her birthday. Jane then kept telling me to just 'pay her back'. I said I would when I get paid from my job.\n\nThe issue then became her texting. She went to our group chat to complain about me not paying her for the clothes she gave me. She ended up letting it slip it was a trade and everyone told her she can't back out of a deal weeks after it happened. She ended up taking to tiktok to complain about how I 'stole' from her and am refusing to pay her back. In response, she was kicked out of the friend group.\n\nHowever now the group is split. Half say I should have just paid her as she does seem to be genuinely struggling, while the other half say I am under no obligation to pay her due to the agreed terms of the trade. The first group think I'm kind of an asshole and Jane definitely thinks I am... so AITA?\n\nEDIT: some people are questioning how my nails cost £160. I do custom sets that involve hours of art/'construction' (of charms, stamps, etc).

      "title": "AITA for admitting I regret having children.",
      "body": "My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). \n\nOur counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said \"honestly, no\". \n\nI love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. \n\nMy wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old \"daddy wishes you were never born\" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.\n\nYes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. \n\nIt has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. \n \nAITA for saying it though?\n\nEdit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. \n\nWhen I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. \n\nYeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  \n\nJust because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. \n\nMy first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.\n\nRegarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.",

      "body": "So, I (31, F) have been making books for my daughters (6 & 2) since my first was born. Every year on their birthdays I write them a letter talking about them and how much I love them and I have been pasting them in a book next to a picture of me and them for each year. I plan on gifting these books to them when they turn 16. My thinking was that we don’t tell the people we love how much we love them and I never want my daughters to question my love. You also never know how life is going to pan out and this way they will always have a personal memento of my own words in case anything were to happen to me. \n\nNow, my husband (33) has always known about this. I was never keeping it from him. I would write the notes on my phone and then when I got the time would write them out to put in the book. He would even go through my phone and take snippets of what I wrote from my notes and post in to his instagram. The problem arose when my oldest daughter had just turned 4 and he came across me actually putting a letter in the book. He looked at the book and the pictures of me and her and said “what about me?” He was angry that I hadn’t included him and insisted that I either go back and change all the letters to say “we” instead of “I” and print new pictures that have him in them or stop making the book. \n\nI haven’t stopped making these books because I think they will be important for my girls to have. I’ve just put them at the back of a cupboard hoping he won’t find them. I feel like they are about my relationship with my daughters and I’m a little sad that my husband doesn’t see the value in that. But I feel uncomfortable that they are now a secret from him. I guess I need some outsider opinions. AITA or is my husband being unreasonable here? \n\nEdit: To be clear, because it seems some people have misinterpreted, these books are not full of photos documenting my children’s lives. Just one page per year with a letter from me and one photo of me with said child. ",

      "body": "\n\nI (17F) have a music class with two sophomore girls (both 15f) named Addison and Hazel (fake names). Addison is a sweetheart and I swear she hung the moon. She’s super kind and very creative, which I get along with. Hazel is very preppy and popular in her grade. For background, I’m bisexual and have been out for about 4 years now. Addison is also on the queer spectrum. Hazel is straight.\n\nYesterday in class, we were tossing light hearted insults back and forth, then mostly calling me old and me mostly calling them short. Hazel called me a dinosaur and I said “Oh I’m sorry, I can’t hear you from all the way down there,” with a small laugh. Hazel immediately shot back, “Well at least I’m not a fucking f*ggot.” With zero hesitation. I was gobsmacked of course, but simply stopped talking to her. After class I pulled her aside in the hall and said, I quote: “Hey, I understand some people are okay with being called that, but I personally have bad history with it. Please don’t call me that again.” I remember every word because I rehearsed it in my head all class. She said “Oh, well it’s okay. I have the pass.” I sorta scoffed and said “Okay, who gave you the pass?” She said her best friend and I said “Yeah, but I didn’t. Please just don’t call me that.” She rolled her eyes and left. \n\nI wasn’t going to really bring it up again, being out for such a long time in the south I’ve heard way worse. But after school Addison sends me a text with a screenshot of a text from Hazel. This is the exact text word for word:\n\n“This one girl got mad at me for saying f*ggot and said not to say it and I said nobody getting affected cuz of it and she said me and I said I got the pass so what?? It's just a word and she who gave u the pass and I said that my best friend and she said I'm not ir best friend\nOOOOO I COULDA SAID SM STUFF BUT I SHUT YP 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻\nBouta piss me off ion like her no ways to hell\nId like her the day it'd be a cold snowy day in HELL”\n\nI honestly got pissed off at her for the sheer audacity, so I got on her Instagram and Snapchat story and collected all the shit she has said about gay people and people of color. I emailed it all to my guidance counselor.\n\nToday she got mad at me because apparently she had to sit out at practice today and she has detention. I told her I didn’t care and it was her fault for talking shit. \n\nAITA?\n\nMini-Update: I’m normally a polite person, but I plan on confronting her today. She hasn’t stopped her shit and she called my close friend (they/them) a ladyboy. It very well may end in a fight, but I outweigh her by 80 pounds so I think I’ll be fine. If reality hasn’t hit her, I guess I’ll have to. Thanks for making me realize just how much of an ass she is.\n\nUpdate: Hey guys thanks for all the support. It was nice to get some feedback, and to the one guy to spammed the f-slur in my dms, you thoroughly made my day. I’m sure you’d like to know that I didn’t get physical with Hazel. I got in touch with my principals and the proper response has arrived. She has out of school suspension for 5 days as apparently this is her not 2nd, not 3rd, but 4th offense. Thanks for those who talked me down about fights, I needed that. xxx",

      "title": "AITA for telling my wife she's unreasonable?",
      "body": "We're having a recurrent argument with my wife of 20 years about a situation with my brother and sister.\n\nFor background, we're pretty wealthy, my wife and I created and sold a business. My brother and sister, on the other hand, are less lucky. All 3 of us got the same education (both my brother and sister have a Master) but my sister somehow ended up as a single mother with 2 kids and basically unemployed. My brother is a private school teacher, which means his salary isn't bad but he's also nowhere near wealthy.\n\nThe argument we keep having relates to my dad, who is also very comfortable in life. He keeps helping out my brother and sister. For instance my sister lives in one of his houses, he gave her 2 cars throughout the years, etc. Basically much of her lifestyle is subsidized by my dad. Same thing with my brother, although to a slightly lesser extent: whenever he needs something he won't buy himself (Apple computer, driving lessons, his wedding, entire relocation cost from moving from one city to another, the security deposit for his new apartment, etc.), my dad is there for him. Even for their kids' clothes (both my brother's and sister's kids), a large part of it is paid for by my dad. I assume that each of them receives north of 10,000 dollars a year worth of various subsidies from my dad.\n\nMy wife says this is unfair because we, on the other hand, receive virtually nothing from him. Our own kids for instance receive maybe 1 gift a year from their grandad, for either Christmas or their birthday. She says we're somehow being punished for making the right choices in life and they are rewarded for their own worse situation, and that this also encourages them to not work as hard as we did. She says fairness would dictate that my dad treats his children the same, giving equal amounts to each. Whenever she hears of a new present my dad gives my sister or brother, she gets very angry at the unfairness of it, and angry at me for not finding the situation abnormal.\n\nMy own point of view is that the situation is fine, and that my dad is on the contrary trying to correct the unfairness of the difference in lifestyle between his kids, helping out my brother and sister who need it more than I do. I'm telling my wife she's trying to create conflict and division within my side of the family when there shouldn't be some, that we really have not much to complain about and that she's unreasonable for having these feelings.\n\nAdditional background that is somewhat relevant: we live far away from home (in Asia) while my brother and sister live in the same country as my dad (France). We however come back home once a year for a few weeks to see my side of the family.\n\nSo what do you think: am I the asshole here, is it normal that my wife feels disappointed and angry?",

      "title": "AITA for telling relatives how much I make and defending my salary?",
      "body": "Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad’s relatives who I don’t see very often. \n\nMy dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven’t either. He’s rude, condescending, and we don’t agree with him on a lot of things. \n\nNormally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job. \n\nI started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I’m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I’ve always wanted. \n\nUncle asked “How much are they paying you anyway?” in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make. \n\nI guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like “Oh, enough” but I told him the number. \n\nHe started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much. \n\nI got pissed and said “I deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can’t do what I do.” \n\nWell, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle’s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn’t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he’s a retired airline pilot, so I don’t think he’s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he’s just a jerk.",

      "body": "My uncle Jesse, aunt Lola and cousin Poppy(F, 6) visited us today. It had been Poppy's birthday last week and we hadn't been able to visit them to wish her, so we gave her the gifts we had bought for her. \n\n\n\nMy parents bought her a doll house and some clothes and I bought her a remote controlled car and some toy binoculars. Aunt Lola and Poppy was very happy and accepted the gifts but my uncle looked annoyed when he saw what I'd bought for Poppy.\n\n\nI asked him if something was wrong and he asked me why I bought \"boys toys\" for his daughter when she was a girl. I asked him if he is saying only boys can play with remote controlled cars and binoculars and he said yes. He asked me why I didn't buy her a doll or a kitchen set or something more feminine. I stared at him incredulously and told him that anyone can play with these and toys aren't gendered, but he kept insisting they are and started to get angry.\n\n\nMy mom told me to let it go but I found it ridiculous that he was already restricting his daughter's choices at such a young age and forcing her to be \"feminine\".\nUncle Jesse then said \"If I had had a son, then these gifts would be acceptable. Unfortunately it is Lola's fault that she gave me a daughter, so don't give Poppy such masculine gifts.\"\n\n\nI knew my uncle wasn't very educated but this was the dumbest thing I had ever heard someone say. I informed him that it was his sperm that decided Poppy would be a girl, it isn't Lola's fault at all. That Lola has XX chromosomes and he had XY chromosomes and I basically went on a rant explaining how everything works. He was extremely angry after this and told me to stop lying and to shut up. He picked up Poppy and told Lola that they're leaving, they took only the gifts my parents brought and asked my parents to \"teach this idiot manners\". My dad yelled at him for saying this and my mom didn't say much to them but told me I had stepped out of line. That I should have just stayed silent and ignored what he had said. She said I was extremely rude. \n\nAITA?",

Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.\n\nIn any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.\n\nI contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.\n\nAITA here?",

I was repeatedly told to shut up and stop being a smartass and that they knew what a camera was. \n\nI asked my wife to record video of the responses for me. \n\nMy cousin was delighted with the pictures from the ceremony, the formals, and the reception. She laughed her ass off at the family pictures. In about half of them people are looking off in all directions instead of at the camera. In most of those there are also people with their mouths open. \n\nShe thought they were hilarious and her husband agreed. \n\nI started getting shit on social media from my family about the terrible pictures. I replied that I had tried to explain to them that the camera was the big black thing on the tripod and that it only took still pictures. They said I should have waited for them to be ready. So I started posting the short video clips of people being jackasses towards me. \n\nMy mom said that I went to far and that they won't ask me to take pictures for them again. A did a fake cry and said boo hoo. She called me a smart Alec. \n\nPlease let me state that I DO NOT THINK I AM THE ASSHOLE IN THIS SITUATION. But many people do.

      "body": "I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",

      "body": "Sorry for any lay out issues, I am on my phone. Also, throwaway as my ex follows my main.\n\n\nBoth myself (F) and my partner (M) were 28 when I found out I was pregnant. Together 4 years. \n\nPersonally I didn't want the child, my work was offering potential advances within my position and I was excited for it. But after alot of talking, we decided to go forward with it. \n\n\nWhen I was around 20 weeks (just after finding out the gender) he disappeared. I couldn't contact him, he wouldn't answer the phone or messages. I got worried and messaged his mother and found out he was living back with her and was overwhelmed with the situation. He kept paying his part of the bills over to my bank each month, but I received no contact. I even tried going over, nothing. \n\n\nBy about 27 weeks I gave up trying, gave up crying and just got on with what I thought was a future as a single mother. I brought everything needed over the next couple of weeks and set it all up. \n\n\nAt 31 weeks I started having pains, but put it down to braxton hicks. Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n\nEdit - thank you all so much for your responses. Sorry for not replying to any. Reading them has been alot. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to drink a bottle of wine (or two), read your kind responses and cry myself to sleep. Writing this all out and living it again has been hard. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to change the locks (landlord said no) but my tenancy ends on the 12th of June and I already have a new flat to move into. And thankfully my dad has been able to cover the cost of a private therapist and I see her again Tuesday. \n\n\nThank you all so much again for your kind words\n\n\n2nd edit: if I had realised this was going to blow up so much then I probably would have just posted to my main.\n\nIf you see this post anyway, read it Lewis. Then read it again. Then read the comments. Then just leave me alone. \n\n\nThank you all for your comments. I'm going to show my therapist the post when I see her and talk it through, but honestly it has helped alot. Even if I did cry quite a bit. I'm going to sleep now and won't be back on this post. But thank you all ♥️",

      "body": "Five years ago, my brother and SIL moved to another state and promised to visit every month which didn't happen: over the next year they visited once and it was for a day and a half. Me and my brother were crazy close growing up and it's a relationship I didn't want to lose. So I decided to pick up my game and try and visit them semi-frequently.\n\nOn not one occasion but TWO, I proposed dates to visit and stay with them (I made sure to ask both because my brother is rubbish at making plans but his wife seemed much better at it), they said yes so I booked tickets, then a week out from the visit they claimed that no plan had ever been made and I couldn't possibly stay at their house because <various reasons which were pretty weak>. So I've stopped talking to them because my brother is terrible at keeping in touch via phone calls/texts and the only way I can have a relationship with him is to actually go visit which they have made impossible and I have paid 800AUD trying to do.\n\nFast forward to a month ago. Our dad has been unwell so my brother called for the first time in ages to check in. I took the call and we chatted for a bit.\n\nA few days later, my SIL messages saying she's sorry for the misunderstandings and she wants to be friends again. I said sure, if you pay for me and one of my kids to go visit them (would cost about $400). She gets all indignant, saying they have done nothing wrong. I say yes you have because <details of plans we made and they disregarded that ended up just costing me money>. She said I have the details wrong, I sent her screenshots of previous conversations disproving her. She said \"I don't want to talk about this any more\" and called the times I spent $800 trying to visit them a \"trivial misunderstanding\". So I've gone back to not speaking to them.\n\nAITA for holding a grudge? Should I just let it go? I can't see a point in re-opening the gates because their combined inability to stick to a plan means even if I did start talking to them, I wouldn't get to see them. Also, I don't even think they want to see me!\n\n",

      "body": "I (f21) was recently cut off by my aunt and cousin (f28). Cousin is having a baby this fall and hosted a baby shower over the weekend. \n\nI have been out of work for 3 months due to layoffs at my company. I drained all of my savings to cover my bills, and started a new job at a grocery store last month. (part time, but it will cover my rent) To be frank, I am broke. Something that has been a point of tension in my family. \n\nCut to 1 month ago, my cousin invited me to her baby shower. I was excited to go, and gladly accepted. 2 weeks ago, she sends out a registry. This registry is EXPENSIVE! When i added the filter for “under $20” only one item showed up and it had been bought. Other items on this list included a $200 breast pump, $160 sneakers (for a BABY), a $500 nursing chair etc. etc. suffice to say, I couldn’t afford what she was asking for. \n\nI replied the next day saying “Hey (cousins name) I am so excited for baby girl!! I noticed some of the items on your list were out of my price range, and didn’t want you to think I wasn’t getting you anything. I will keep you stocked up in diapers! Love you” \n\nAfter a day of not hearing anything, i got a call from my aunt saying i was an “ungrateful child with no family loyalty” \n\nI tried to explain myself, but it only led to more hurtful words, and eventually my cousin hopped on the phone and told me to never speak to her again. \n\nSo, I didn’t go to the baby shower. When asked why I wasn’t there, cousin said it was because i didn’t care about her or her baby. (according to other family who was there) I haven’t said anything to my other cousins or grandparents about these because i generally like to avoid drama. \n\nI was hoping it was her pregnancy hormones talking, but it’s been 2 weeks and i haven’t heard from her. I feel bad for my mom because she’s caught in the middle and my family has been texting me asking what happened. \n\nSo, Am I the asshole? \n\n\nTLDR - I’m too poor to afford my bougie cousin’s registry items. \n\nUPDATE!!!!\n\nThis will be my last update, I want to thank everyone for their words of encouragement. \n\nI went to my grandparents house before work this morning to talk to my grandma and explain what happened. As you all suspected, my cousin had been there already this week spreading her story. I showed my grandma the message I sent cousin, and she immediately told me she understood. As i was leaving (with a fresh muffin, thanks gammy!!) I saw my cousin’s car pulling into the drive. I won’t lie, I think my uncle texted her that I was there. (he works on their land) She didn’t say anything at first, so i started walking to my car thinking it would be best for me to leave. she stopped me and we ended up talking it out like civil adults. She explained that she wanted cloth diapers for her baby, and me saying I would get disposable diapers felt like a slap to her choices as a mother. she cited her pregnancy hormones and apologized for having her mom take things too far. I had to leave so I wasn’t late for work, but we made plans for her to come over tomorrow for dinner. We have my grandparents anniversary this weekend, and we plan to tell everyone what really happened then. \n\nFor those worried about my mom being involved, she’s my mom. she will never NOT be involved in the trivial things of my life. If i had beef with the mailman, she’d be calling the post office. BUT, you’re right and I shouldn’t have been relying on her to push out my side of the story. She’s the best and just wants to protect me always!! I won’t get into her issues with her sister because it’s not my business or my story to tell. \n\nThanks, reddit! ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my family that if they want Thanksgiving, they'll have to get off their asses and plan it?",
      "body": "Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help \"sponsor\" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.\n\nOther than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: \"So did we get a turkey?\"\n\nI looked at him and said \"Well, I know I didn't. Did you?\"\n\nHe stared at me blankly and said \"No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?\"\n\nI shrugged and said \"I don't know nothing about no turkey.\"\n\nThe kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said \"I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.\"\n\nHe blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.\n\nI said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?\n\nHe just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his \"office\" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.\n\nSo I just looked at him and said \"Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?\"\n\nHe told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.\n\nBefore you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.\n\nAITA?\n\n**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was \"getting down on the floor playing\" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.\n\nAnyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.\n\nThe kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.\n\nAlso, we don't do Christmas. \n\nCheck your biases, folks. Don't leap to conclusions based on what you *want* to have happened.",

      "title": "AITA for naming my baby after my grandmother?",
      "body": "I had my second daughter a few weeks ago and named her Gabriella. My cousin's daughter, who is 1 year older, is also named Gabriella. For context, this is my grandmother's name (unrelated to my cousin) so last year when abuela heard about my cousin's Gabriella, she was so delighted to have a baby with her name. Seeing this, we thought my abuela would be even happier if her great granddaughter was named after her.\n\nNow, at the most recent family dinner I overheard a couple family members talking about how it was weird that I named my daughter Gabriella, because my cousin's daughter is already named that. As far as I know it's just a name that they like and bears no special significance/family name. I also saw my cousin and she was acting a bit weird/cold towards me.\n\nSince we have a big Latino family all in the same city (9 babies/toddlers in total) we all see each other quite a bit at holidays, birthdays, etc. I wonder if they're upset that it'll be awkward with the same name.\n\nI feel like 1) no one should have a \"claim\" to a name and 2) if anything, my abuela had the name first on my side of the family, so \"Gabriella\" has much more meaning to us. Another relative also suggested using nicknames to differentiate them, but my grandmother goes by \"Gabby\" so that's what we would want to use too; however, my cousin already calls her baby Gabby.\n\nAITA for naming my baby after my abuela?\n \n\n",

First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was \"real\" or just 'lenses\", also asked about how I spend my time when \"alone\" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying \"keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!\". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an \"attitude\". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.\n\nI went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I \"ruined\" it for myself and cost him his job.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for getting a babysitter because my mom was keeping her home",
      "body": "I'm a single mom with a 4 year old daughter, Anna. Anna and I live with my mom. We both work and Anna goes to daycare full time. Daycare would be about half my income so I get a subsidy that covers $1400 out of her $2000 tuition. The only condition of the subsidy is that she actually has to show up. If she misses too many days I lose the subsidy. I go to work at 7:30 and daycare opens at 8 so my mom would be the one to take Anna to daycare. \n\nAnna's main teacher is a 20/21 year old girl. When I've talked to her she's always been very animated and energetic. She's great with the kids. Anna always comes home saying this teacher brought stickers, she brought juice, she brought bubbles, she did face painting, etc. and always has fun crafts that she did with her teacher. This teacher is her favorite person in the world right now and Anna often runs away from my mom to jump on this teacher in the mornings and hides when my mom picks her up because she doesn't want to leave this teacher.\n\nMy mom started to get jealous that Anna likes the teacher better than her so she started keeping her home from daycare on her days off/when she only has 1-2 easy clients (she cleans houses). \n\nI found out Anna missed 5 days over the past 3 weeks. I asked my mom about it and she told me she wanted Anna to spend more time with family instead of with teachers I told my mom Anna needs to be in daycare unless she's sick or I would lose the subsidy. She was arguing that if Anna needs to be in daycare, she should be in one with more family values and not some \"rich white girl trying to save the poor kids\" (the teacher is a girl from a well off family marrying into a well off family and the daycare isn't in the most well off neighborhood.) She has bins full of clothes for the kids, gave everyone a water bottle with their name on it, has a much nicer classroom than the other teachers, and drives a car worth more than my mom and I combined could make in a year. She's setting up a field trip to the local airport so her fiance can talk to the kids about flying planes and so they can look at his jet. I told her I wouldn't. This is the best daycare that takes this subsidy and I won't be moving her just because she's jealous. \n\nShe was still insisting on Anna either being with family or being in a more family based daycare so I got her a babysitter. I drop her off to my neighbor at 7:30 when I leave for work and she drops Anna off at 8:15 on her way to take her kids to school. She only charges me $10 a day. I don't love the breakfasts that she gives Anna but I know she's going to daycare and I won't lose the subsidy. \n\nNow my mom is pissed that I'm keeping Anna away from her. AITA for sending Anna to a babysitter in the mornings because my mom wasn't taking Anna to daycare?",

      "title": "AITA for wasting everyone's time in therapy because I was accused of lying?",
      "body": "My mom, her husband and I (16f) are in group therapy with each other. We started therapy a few weeks after Father's Day, because that was the final straw for them to insist we all needed therapy to work on why I won't let us be the family they want. We started at the end of July and by the end of August my mom accused me of lying, called me a liar and laid out this really big sob story about how much it hurt to have me lie to her and do everything in my power to destroy her marriage.\n\nIt pissed me off so bad. I didn't lie at any point of this. I said as much in the follow up session and the therapist asked me to outline my side and how I felt having mom call me a liar. My mom kept trying to interrupt me, she told the therapist the shut up and she accused me of being a vicious liar then.\n\nTo give some explanation about the situation. My mom and her husband got married 3 years ago. They moved in together 2 months before. Before moving in they sat me down and asked me if I was okay with us moving in together and making a family of three again. Mom brought up how we'd have a man around the house again (my dad died) and how good it would be for her to have a husband and for me to have a dad and he said he couldn't wait to be my dad and he always wanted to be a dad. He said he already had plans for us for Father's Day. This was February of three years ago. I told them I wasn't okay with that stuff. That I didn't want another dad, wouldn't let him be my dad, and was not about to spend Father's Day celebrating someone who isn't dad. They started laughing and proceeded as normal but Father's Day became a struggle because I have not spent the day with him the last three years and he has tried, so has my mom. I meant what I said. I never called him dad or let him fill the role in my life. This year he snapped and he had a temper tantrum and said I was supposed to be with him on Father's Day and not spending the day alone and he didn't sign up to be nothing to me.\n\nMy mom called me a liar because she said I promised to develop a close relationship with her husband and that I said yes to wanting what they asked. She said I had said I would give him Father's Day and I lied and I have not followed through on any of it. She said I made them think I would be a willing participant and I wanted us to be a family. It pisses me off because I never said what she claims and I even repeated what I had said back then. \n\nThe therapist couldn't get mom to apologize and she has no control over the sessions where my mom and her husband dominate. So I'm totally silent and I zone out. They only realized this two weeks ago. They called me on it and I spoke up again after more than a month of no talking in therapy, to confirm I wasn't listening and it came up last week and I said I was done engaging because I was owed an apology for being called a liar. My mom and her husband are pissed that I'm wasting everyone's time letting therapy happen. \n\nAITA?",

Next thing I know I’m walking myself down the aisle with no mom,grandma, or family friend in sight. The ceremony continues and it’s over before we know it.\n\n   Still nothing, after 45 minutes finally they pull up. Then I proceed to go and tell them it’s over and that they missed it and that 2 meant 2. My mother immediately became hostile and proceeded to blame the bakery for not having buns ready, then said they were stopped by a train and my personal favourite was “It’s your fault you didn’t call or text to see where we are”. EXCUSE ME!! Again the invitation said 2. \n\nAlso note the officiant also had another wedding to get to after mine so it was a tight schedule. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not holding up my ceremony. Side note I found out the real reason why they were late, she wasn’t done getting herself ready therefore holding up everyone. But she is mad at me because it’s my fault. ",

      "body": "My sister and her husband invited me over to their pool today for a little BBQ. I assumed it would just be me, my sister, her husband, my nephews, and my parents. But turns out they also invited her husband’s side of the family. \n\nWhen it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I’m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they’re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You’d have to look really close to even notice. \n\nI’ve been to their pool many times and she’s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. \n\nWhen I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I’m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn’t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. \n\nShe told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. \n\nWhen she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn’t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn’t expect her to ask me this. \n\nMy mood was soured after that and I didn’t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. \n\nI told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. \n\nMy parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she’s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn’t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.\n\nWhat she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn’t mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?",

      "body": "I (18NB) am currently living with my bio mom (42F) and youngest sister (9F). We all live in a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house with a partially done basement that costs $1,200 a month in rent. Our landlord covers all things that need fixing and lawncare/snow removal.\n\nI just graduated high-school this May, and while I was job hunting, my bio mom suggested that I take over cleaning for the building where she works a desk job. I'm earning $20 an hour, but the max her and mine's boss wants me there a day is 3-4 hours, 5 if I need to mop. \n\nI do not have a functioning car.l, but I do have a driver's license, so I'm dependent on having access to my mother's car, or having someone drive me to and from work. \n\nI'm considering getting another part time job, but I really can't do anything until she's done working, because that's when I can use her car.\n\nEven then, she'll make plans for after work that keep me from using the car, or insist on going and doing stuff as a family when I have work. Not to mention, most of the cleaning and pet care that gets done at home is only done by me, since my younger sister doesn't know how to do any chore other than clean her room. I feel stuck and overwhelmed, and I can't just leave her house yet, and when I try to bring this up, she gets upset and makes it all about her. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your advice and help. I, surprisingly, managed to convince her to lower the payment to $300 a month for me until I get a better job. I also applied to another job for a night shift that pays a little more and also has a $2,000 sign-on bonus, so hopefully that works. I hope you all have a great week!",

      "body": "My sister in law and I have an agreement. She watches my kids 3 days a week, and I watch hers 3 days a week. This agreement has stood since March 2020 without issues. Any changes have been discussed weeks in advance.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had an argument. The next day, I brought my kids to her house, dropped them off, and left. I didn't speak to my sister in law, because when one of us is in a rush, like I was, it's standard for us to just let the kids out, stay in the car, and drive off when you see the door open.\n\nI drove to work, about 40 minutes away. When I got there, I had about 20 missed calls, and even more texts, all from my sister in law, all saying she didn't want to watch the kids given our argument. Her first text arrived a little before I got to her place, but I didn't see it until I got to work because my phone is always on silent when I drive. I rang her, said I'll arrange to work from home, then come get the kids. She said I have 45 mins to get back to her place or she would call the police.\n\nI told my supervisor the situation, and she said I could leave after I did a few things. This delayed me 20 mins. When I got back to my sister in law's, just over an hour later, she said she'd already called the police when the 45 mins ran out. I then had to stick around long enough to tell the officer that I didn't abandon my children, there was just a communication issue.\n\nSister in law and I had another shouting match later over this. I arranged other childcare for my kids and I've been mostly ignoring her since. However, she reached out and apologised, and has asked if I'd be willing to go back to the old childcare arrangement. I've told her to go fuck herself.\n\nI work with kids. If I got child abandonment on my record, I would never work in my field again, which she knew, and her calling the police was a *massive* overreaction, so if she needs a babysitter she can go whistle for all I care. She said that if I checked my phone, talked to her that morning, or came back when I was supposed to, she would not have needed to call the police, and I did this to myself, as she gave me a warning with that first text and I could have checked my phone or spoken to her directly when I got to her place, all of which she says she would have done if she were in my position, given that we'd argued the night before. I've told her that if she thinks I'm babysitting for her, she's fucking delusional, and she's on her own.\n\nBecause of my refusal, it's looking like she may have to quit her job because my brother and her would pay more for a babysitter than they would earn from her working. My mother and brother have both called me an arsehole because there were no consequences to her calling the police, and that while she overreacted, she's apologised, so if I really forgive her, I'll let us move on. This income loss would also mean that she, my brother, and my niece and nephew might need to move somewhere cheaper, that my brother might have to take on extra hours at work, and in an extreme scenario they may even be completely unable to live independently, meaning they'd have to move in with her parents, who live several hours away.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend it's disgusting to spread ketchup on pie with their finger?",
      "body": "So this happened a couple days ago, and I’m still kinda weirded out by it. I (21F) was hanging out with my friend “Kayla” (22F) at her place. We were having a super chill night, movies, snacks, and she offered to heat up some meat pies she had made. I said yes because Kayla’s actually a decent cook and I was hungry.\n\nAnyway, the pies come out, and she asks if I want ketchup on mine. I say sure. I figured she’d just hand me the bottle or squirt some on top. But instead, she squirts a big glob of ketchup onto her own pie, then spreads it around with her bare finger like she was icing a cake. And then she does the same to mine before I can say anything.\n\nI was honestly taken aback. I asked, “Did you just use your finger to spread that?” She kinda laughed and said, “Yeah? It’s just ketchup, relax.”\n\nI told her it was kind of gross and I’d prefer she not do that to my food. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it's no different than finger food, and that I was being “weirdly stuck up” about it. I told her I just don't like the idea of someone else's bare finger in my food, especially when there are literally knives or spoons right there.\n\nIt turned into this awkward little spat where she accused me of judging her, I was more so just disgusted at the general view of watching her do it, and the fact that I'm already somewhat grossed out by ketchup really didn't help the fact. It ended up turning into a stupidly serious argument, and she was cold for the rest of the night. \n\nI tried talking to her the other day, but she hasn't responded to my texts. When I told my boyfriend about it later, he kind of laughed and said yeah, it’s weird, but maybe I overreacted by making her feel bad about it.\n\nSo now I’m wondering… was I being too uptight? I still hold the opinion that it was gross but maybe I made it too big a deal? AITA for calling her out on using her finger to spread ketchup on my food?",

      "body": "My gf and I live together. I am 29 and she is 26. We’ve lived together for 6 months. I have been very busy at work and with life so yesterday I was really looking forward to cooking dinner for gf and I and relaxing. We had this planned all weekend. My gf is more of a social butterfly than I am so she had plans yesterday morning with her friends. She had brunch at 11 and I was planning on having dinner ready by 630. I expected her to have a few mimosas at breakfast but nothing too crazy. Maybe she’d get home and take a nappy nap before dinner. \n\nBasically brunch turned into going to one more bar after (around 1 PM). Whichhhh turned into more bars. Which basically became bar hopping all day. She was texting me insisting that she will be home in time for dinner but by the way she was talking I could tell she was drunk. I started making the pasta around 5 pm. Around 530 I saw on her snap story that she was doing shots at a bar in a completely different neighborhood of Chicago. I didn’t want to be the boyfriend who nags so I let it go. I was getting seriously annoyed because I was thinking ohhh great she’s gonna be hammered for our nice night we had planned. \n\nAt 630 she was not home yet. I saw on her location that she was now at a *different* bar from where they were taking shots at. I ate and asked my friends if they wanted to play PlayStation so I packed up the food, put it in the fridge and hopped on PlayStation with the boys. \n\nGf arrived home around 715 PM clearly drunk. She asked wtf I was doing and what about dinner. I said she was late, and dinner was done but it’s In the fridge so she can heat some up if she wants. She apologized for being a little bit late but basically gave me a half assed laughing apology saying “you never know what to expect when the girl gang goes to brunch” I said that’s fine but I now have other plans. She called me rude and went to bed. We haven’t talked much about it today but I can tell she is being passive aggressive so am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: oh and she also went and said my dinner didn’t look very good so she door dashed Taco Bell \n\nUPDATE: gf and I talked. We are okay for the most part. She did sincerely apologize and admitted to her fucking up. She said she wished I came when she invited me though after she learned it might be out longer than like 2 PM. \n\nThis started another issue or think we need to figure out in our relationship. She opened up and said she wished sometimes I was more outgoing and social. She wishes I wasn’t fine with sitting around the apartment all the time. ",

      "title": "AITA for ‘inserting myself’ into someone else’s dinner situation?",
      "body": "Update at the bottom. \n\nThrowaway. Ok I know the title is confusing but hear me out. I went out to eat with my (34f) bf (35m) and a two other couples. For context I am a mother to a 5yr old (not my bf child). So two tables away was a new parent couple & what I can only assume was the guys parents. I assumed this because I was that girl when I first had my child. Out to dinner with your fathers child and his family and baby is being fussy- you’re struggling and no one is helping you. Baby’s crying for about 15 min now all while the father or no one else for that matter is offering her any help or a break so she can have at least a bite of her food that’s been sitting there cold for about 30 min. I really just wanted to run to her grab the baby for a bit and tell her to eat. \n\nThis is where I might I have been an asshole:baby’s crying (again no one paying attention) and she goes to comfort baby and breastfeed. Well ALL of a sudden she’s the center of attention! Baby father says what are you doing? That’s disgusting go to a stall in the bathroom! At this point I lost it. My bf was trying to calm me down the entire time telling me it’s none of my business but I just went ham. I got up from my table walked over and told him if he found it so disgusting why doesn’t he go eat his sandwich on the the toilet. I said she has been struggling, hasn’t had a bite to eat all while the 3 of you sit there enjoying yourselves and letting her drown.\nAnd then I said loud enough that the tables around could hear that anyone who is offended by a woman breastfeeding needs to get checked because breasts weren’t made for men to suck on for pleasure they were made for feeding and that’s exactly what she’s doing. \nNo one said anything but she also didn’t go to the bathroom and finished feeding her baby who calmed down and she was able to eat. \nMy bf is upset I caused a scene in front of some of his friends and everyone really at the restaurant but I just couldn’t sit back watch, and say nothing. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for inserting myself and yelling at strangers?\n\nJust some clarification after all the comments: I do agree and feel terrible that I could have put her in a position to get yelled at later. That wasn’t my intention. I saw red, mostly because I have been through exactly this and have gone home in tears and feeling alone. I would normally not get into anyones business. I appreciate all your feedback and for sure next time I feel the urge to say something I’m going to take a breath and find a better way to communicate that doesn’t put anyone in danger or interrupt other people. My bf is still not talking to me until I apologize because again I embarrassed him, regardless of the reason. Feel like I should just send a text to his friends and keep it moving.\n\nUpdate:\nWow guys- thank you for all the responses, support, advice and criticism. These past 24hrs have been crazy, so here’s a quick update. \n\nI mentioned in a previous comment but will say again that the young mom did give me a smile as we were saying our goodbyes in the parking lot and they were leaving. In terms of this situation like I said I could of had more tact and really hope I didn’t expose her to more abuse in retaliation. \n\nAs for my boyfriend- well now ex because HE BROKE UP (well told me he needed space) with me. I showed him the thread and this is what happened:\n\n1. Super pissed that I posted this on here. ‘Why am I putting our business out on the internet?’ And basically I wanted people to turn against him (what?!) and more attention then I already took at the restaurant \n2. One of his friends is very conservative and while his friend didn’t actually say anything to my ex he says his friend was definitely offended by the breastfeeding at the table because it’s not hygienic. He doesn’t agree that she should have gone to bathroom but it wasn’t the appropriate place to feed.\n3. One of the things he liked about me was how I kept my ‘mom life’ separate from my relationship with him. And that while he was weirded out that I never invited him to my house the entire time we’ve been dating (2yrs) he appreciated not having to be involved because he has never wanted kids. Doesn’t like them. So basically I set a boundary from the beginning of ‘no kid stuff’ I crossed it at the restaurant and made a big scene in front of his friends who he says were also embarrassed but weren’t going to say anything. \n\nSo like this is all still going on. I’m a bit sad - like maybe I did do the most- but also I’m like f him. Since me and my daughters dad split 50/50 I can see how someone can see me and not realize that I’m a whole ass mother. The reason I don’t let people I’m dating come to my house is because at the end of the day I don’t know these people from Adam (did you torture animals as a child 🤷🏽‍♀️) and rather than expose my daughter to variables (guys character or behaviors) I prefer if they don’t have access. I know it may sound crazy or weird, but when I was in college a guy I dated would show up to my apartment drunk yelling for me outside my window. So I’m not leaving the door even cracked for something like this to happen and my daughter be home with me. She’d be terrified. \n\nSo what he said was he needed a break and I just said let’s just not do this at all because it’s not gonna work. For sure I set boundaries with my kid but if anything involving kids is a problem than we aren’t going to work because again I am a mother. And even on my days ‘off’ I’m on call because anything can happen and I need to be there regardless. \n\nThank you guys for all your responses. It’s hard sometimes when things blow up like this to whisk away the bullshit and see things for what they are.",

      "body": "**EDIT** PLEASE STOP SENDING ME CHAT MESSAGES I cannot keep up with ALL of the stuff I'm seeing. **YES EVEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY \"I KNOW YOU SAID DON'T MESSAGE ME BUT...**\n\nYears ago I got really into houseplants and started to collect them. Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love.\n\nMy niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting. \n\nI had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off.\n\nThey agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts.\n\nWell I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones.\n\nMy prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron.\n\nThe worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized. \n\nI basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS\n\nSIL got between us and said \"what's done is done\n\n**im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!**\n\nI said no way, you're returning EVERYTHING\nJenny said \"Mom already sold most of them on marketplace\"\nI lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.\nHe brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.\nI told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.\nSo AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?",

I have done this in the past and just as I did in those instances I happily said not a problem.

At 3:20pm I messaged her saying I am going back inside if she wants to leave me written instructions I will do my best to follow them. At 4:15pm she messaged me and said sorry work got busy. She arrived home at 4:40pm. At 5:40pm, 20 minutes before I begin my remote job she came downstairs and apologized again, I said not a problem life happens. She then asked me if I had time to come walk the yard with her, I said unfortunately I no longer have time today as I was in the middle of making a smoothie and getting signed in / setup for work. She then became extremely upset yelling at me saying I am disrespectful and that this is my 30 days notice to be no longer living here. I understand that I have legal protections and cannot be evicted over this but to make things simple I am moving out and probably going no contact. I just wanna know, AITA here?",

      "body": "I (56F) have a son and  things have been tense because of his wife, “Emily” (28F). I’ve noticed over the past year that Emily tends to stretch the truth or flat-out lie about things, both big and small. At first, it was little things like saying she couldn’t come to family dinners because of work, only to post on social media that she was out with friends. Then it escalated to bigger things.\n\nOne example that really bothered me happened recently. We were both supposed to attend a charity fundraiser I was there the entire evening and never saw her. When I later asked if she had made it, she insisted that she had been there the whole time and even said she saw me but was too busy to come say hi. This wasn’t true—I know for a fact she wasn’t there the volenteers list was small and I definitely would have seen her. We were all in the same room.\n\nMore recently, she lied about something involving a family event. We were planning a small gathering for my husband’s birthday, and Emily told me she’d arranged a cake from his favorite bakery. The day of the party, she showed up empty-handed, claiming they “lost the order.” When I called the bakery to see what happened, they had no record of any order ever being placed. \n\nThat was the last straw for me.\n\nI pulled her aside later and confronted her about her constant lying. I tried to be calm and respectful, but I told her that her dishonesty was starting to affect how I viewed her and that it was creating tension in the family. She literally messed up my husband birthday with these lies.  \n\nShe completely denied it and got really upset, saying I was making her out to be a bad person and that I was overreacting. My son got involved and is now angry with me.\n\nThe whole thing has caused a rift, and now Emily refuses to come to any family gatherings unless I apologize. I feel like I had every right to call her out, and I have nothing to apolgize for.",

      "body": "There’s a TL;DR at the bottom, I don’t blame you. This is about to be a lot of words and sentences. I did edit this to meet the character limit. \n\nI (41 M) and my partner (39 F) usually do lunch then groceries on Saturdays.\n\nOn this particular Saturday in November, I woke up at 9-10am. My partner was on the couch watching tv. I asked her if we wanted to get ready to grab food and groceries. She said no. I assumed she wanted to continue watching tv so I started doing some laundry. I laid around in bed with our dogs as my laundry was washing/drying. I did two loads of laundry. Washed, dried, and folded. \n\nShe was still on the couch watching tv when I finished so I asked again, “Lunch and groceries?”. She replied “I’m not hungry, I already snacked on something”.  I said “Ok, well I’m hungry. I’m going to shower then go out to find some food”. She said ok. After I got ready I asked again if she wanted to go. She replies “No, why would I go sit and watch you eat and drink when I’m not hungry?”. She joked that we had cans of chicken noodle soup in the pantry. I replied “What is a can of that going to do for my fat ass?”. We laughed, kissed, and I headed out. \n\nThinking she wanted a lazy day, I figured I’d eat then grab the essential groceries before I came home. After some internal debate, I chose a restaurant near the grocery store. It’s around 1-2pm at this point. As I sit and watch a college football game, she calls. I pick up and am met with: “Where you at?!”. I told her I had just sat down at (name of restaurant). We share our location through our phones. She already knew where I was. “Uh-huh. With who?!” “No one. Just me and a beer.”\n\nShe had some strong, choice words, then hung up on me. I HATE being hung up on, hate it, and she knows that. This obviously confused and upset me. We were just laughing and kissing 20 minutes earlier. I finish my beer and box up my untouched food. I get home and after a few hours of the silent treatment she asks “Are you ready to apologize??!” (For going out to eat alone?). I replied “Me?! Are YOU ready to apologize??” (For cursing at me then hanging up). She said she was under the impression that I was picking up food and coming home.\n\nFast forward to April, we’re walking through a hotel to grab a drink. Her and her brother were recalling a story from their past. She leans over and says, “That’s why I was so pissed off that day. My dad used to do that shit all the time. He would go sit at a bar all day, drink, and flirt with women. My mom would drive us there at some point to drag him back home”. I drink but I am NOT that type. If I had known this was triggering, I would have just stayed home and ate the can of chicken noodle soup.\n\nTL;DR \nI went to have lunch by myself which triggered a bad memory of her dad (that I wasn’t privy to) AITAH?",

I obviously thought that was stupid and I rolled my eyes at her and walked away. Also when I was on call with him she freaked out at me grabbed the phone and demanded that I break up with him. I again obviously said no.\n\nBut today is where I draw the line, I was texting my friend after going to the gym with my sister,and she said that her and my bf were free to hang out I was obviously very happy because I love him but her immediate reaction was to yell at me to not go. I called her out and said that she’s being unfair and that she hangs out with her friends all the time but she threw her half full bottle of water at me and stormed off back home. Am I the AH?",

She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.\n\nBoy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.\n\nI broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.\n\nI said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.\n\neverything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.\n\nmoms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.\n\nDid I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.\n\nI've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.\n\n3000 char limit is an AH\n\n\nEDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.\n\nedit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.\n\n\nEDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.\n\n\nEDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all right\n\nedit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point.",

      "body": "Posting this from my lurking account. Basically, would I be the asshole to ask my (heavy user) family member to stop helping themselves to my stash?  I have a family member who I’m very close to.  I love them to death, but the issue is that whenever they come over, they help themselves to what I have. (We live in a state where it’s legal and we source it from a reputable and licensed business.)\n\nIt’s getting to the point where they consume all of their shit and then proceed to consume mine.  I don’t mind sharing: they share with me (they were actually the one who introduced me to this) but the amount that they take from me is way, way more. To the point where I go home and my whole supply, which is supposed to last me for literal weeks, is gone.  Again, I don’t mind sharing, but they’re literally leaving me with nothing and not saying anything or half heartedly offering to replace only part of what they consume.  I’ve only been reimbursed once.  I may be the asshole because they share with me on occasion and are generous in other ways, but I also don’t want to fund someone else’s habit and never have anything for me.  They justify it by saying it’s because I’m a light user, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m losing like 80 bucks a month for shit I don’t even get to use. I would also care much less if they actually asked me instead of leaving me to find out, but because I’m much younger, it’s like ‘disrespectful’ or something. WIBTA for asking them to stop, or at least chill out a little bit?",

      "title": "AITA for telling mom \"no apology, no wedding invitation\" after seeing the wedding gift she gave my fiancè?",
      "body": "I f25 am getting married to my fiance \"Kevin\" next month. My family love Kevin and Kevin loves them. However, my mom is the \"brutally honest\" type who constantly dish out her opinions and thought on what people wear, how they look, how well off they are... Mostly negative, tasteless, backhanded comments. She says she can't help it and that no one should be offended when she's just being honest.\n\n\nWhen she met Kevin, she kept making comments about him, his car, his degree etc. With time and strict conversations I was able to get her to show some respect. But she kept annoying Kevin by constantly talking about his hairless face (his face is clean he doesn't have a beard or mustache which he can be very insecure about, he comes from Irish origins so he's white, he has no facial hair while I'm hispanic) mom made jokes with her husband about how \"unmanly\" it is to not be able to grow a beard or a mustache. Those comments hurt Kevin so much. I had as very very stern conversation with her and she said \"oh I didn't realize those remarks were offending him I was just teasing him\" or \"you know me I'm just giving my humble, honest opinion so he shouldn't take it personal and should learn that this is how I am\". She ended up sincerely apologizing to Kevin and we left it at that.\n\nAs the wedding is approaching. Mom decided to give Kevin a wedding gift and also to let him know how sorry she was for her past behavior. She invited the whole family for dinner and decided it was the perfect time to hand Kevin his wedding gift. He thanked her but she insisted that he open it right there and then and show everyone what she got him since she knew him that well already. He opened the box and found a set of shaving tools with a shaving cream. Kevin stopped for a sec and kept staring at the gift. My stepdad took it and showed everyone then mom and others started laughing while stepdad kept saying \" you get the joke Kev? You get it?\". And my brother running around the table laughing with everyone. Kevin got up and walked out. I was so mad I lost it on mom asking why she did that and humiliated Kevin infront of everyone. She told me to relax she was just messing with him but I said she knew how he felt about this topic and demanded she apologize but she said no since she wasn't responsible for his reaction and thought he was going to laugh along. I angrily said \" no apology, no wedding invitation, period\" then walked out. She freaked out calling try to say we overreacted to a joke and my brother said I was crazy to exclude mom from my wedding over something so stupid. he said Kevin should get over it since it was a joke but I refused to send an invitation and withheld until/unless she apologizes. They think I'm unreasonable choosing this to be my hill to die on and called me disrespectful for how I treated my mom.\n\n* I'd like to point out that my brother and stepdad and uncle sometimes take part in teasing Kevin. My brother (who's 31 years old) would sometimes either brag about his goatee mustache infront of Kevin or tell an indirect silly joke about this topic wich would irritate Kevin and just spoil any family gathering we have. But mom is the one who started this whole campaigne and I've already had conversations with her about it.\n\n* Kevin is American but has Irish origins.",

      "body": "I'm (17m) the second youngest in my family. I have two sisters and a brother, Jessie (23f), Caden (21m) and Luna (14f). This post is about Luna. We're the only two siblings still living at home and our parents do provide us with food and stuff. But my parents aren't big on chocolate or candies so they never buy them. We can buy our own with our own money once we're old enough to earn some, which is what I do. My parents also have a very bland palate. They don't like curries or stir fries with sauce, they don't do anything spicy at all. Not even a touch of spice. But I love those things. So sometimes I buy stuff to make those things and make curry for myself or I'll make spicy chicken.\n\nSo onto Luna. She's the baby of the family and our parents spoiled her way more than the rest of us. They let her get away with being a brat to people and she's not someone I like being around and neither do our older siblings. She always wants to tell us what to do and she demands things. One time my parents were away at a wedding and Jessie and Caden came home to \"babysit\" which was just my parents saying they could stay at the house and eat for free because they paid for it and make sure Luna and I were okay. This was last year and Luna screamed so loud the neighbor came out to see if we were okay, and it was all because she wanted pizza while we wanted ramen. Luna said we couldn't have ramen and we all needed to get pizza. She tried taking the money out of Jessie's hand. She tried to break Jessie and Caden's phones. She even screamed at the neighbor that we wouldn't let her get pizza. Caden found a frozen pizza and Luna screamed more that it wasn't what she wanted.\n\nAnother time Caden was home from college and she demanded he take her to her friends house because mom and dad weren't home. She pulled him out of bed. She threatened to break his laptop. Everything.\n\nShe's always telling me to do stuff for her and screaming when I say no. So I never buy her anything from what I earn because I honestly don't feel like she deserves it.\n\nLately she's been getting so jealous of the food I buy myself and she told me to save some for her. I told her no. She told me I can't tell her no and I said I can and I did and I'll do it again. She screamed into my face and demanded I give her some of my food. I said no. She has food in the fridge. She ran and told our parents and like they always do, they backed her and told me I should be willing to share. I told them I would share when she treats me better and gets a way better attitude.\n\nMy parents and Luna are pissed. Luna called me a jerk and my parents said I wasn't being generous like they taught me to be.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "Allow me to set the stage.\n\nThe members of my group-chat were initially highschool and college friends of mine.  Over time, friends-of-friends (or people of that general category) were added, far removed from the intimate circle we once had.  One such addition I always found to be extremely grating; he was older (let's say early-40s) and reveled in being nasty hygienically and in spirit.\n\n*When I say nasty in sprit, I mean to say that that he possessed every single negative attribute assignable to someone's character, but in varying degrees.  He was, for example, rather greedy and unreliable, but he was significantly more the former than the latter.  He was the cartoon caricature of a creep, adapted to live-action and himself a bad act.*\n\nMany times, his contributions to the chat, attempts at humor, would be revolting.  He would, for example, send pictures of his shits to the chat and selfies of himself lying next to sleeping nude prostitutes.\n\nI would allow the other members to deal with it as some would possess a similar revulsion as me.\n\n\\-\n\nOne day, this guy revealed to the chat something that really set me off; he shared a video of himself tampering with someone's food (he worked in a restaurant).  In the video, he was smearing food from the garbage onto people's plates, tossing things on the floor and placing them back on the plate with a grin and a wink before setting it out to be served.  The group was very upset and called him out and it devolved into a fight.\n\nThere's something about deliberately messing with other people's food without their knowledge that I find horrifying.  I hope I don't need to elaborate and that all reading this understand.\n\nI spoke with my friend whose friend-of-a-friend he was and got just enough information about where he worked to contact the restaurant.  I emailed them the video anonymously, knowing that I could still be held as suspect should the video be shown to him.\n\nI don't know if the video was shown to him or not, but he immediately assumed it was someone in the chat and flew into a rage.  I'm not sure if he knew it was me because he jumped around in his accusations.\n\nDespite his conduct previously, this meltdown was enough for him to be removed.\n\nI ask in this context, knowing the situation, was/am I an asshole?",

      "body": "I’m a guy in my early 20s and my girlfriend (same age) works in tech. She really hates when I use certain online tools to answer questions, especially anything involving automation or predictive systems. She says they are unreliable, inaccurate, and people use them as a crutch. But honestly I think part of it is that she is worried about job security and uses that to act like she knows better.\n\nShe often acts like she is an authority on all of this even though she does not work in that area. She took one class on it back in university but now works maintaining outdated software for old hardware used in niche industries. It is not exactly cutting edge but she still talks like she has it all figured out.\n\nA few months ago she asked me not to use these tools in our conversations. Like if we are texting and something comes up she did not want me to say I checked this online assistant. I used to do that a lot with random stuff. One time she casually mentioned that the moon looked orange and I replied with a detailed explanation I found about why that happens. She got annoyed and said she already knew and did not like being talked down to. I was not trying to correct her, I was just interested in the answer and shared it.\n\nSo I stopped mentioning it when we talk but I still use it on my own. If we are wondering about something or having a debate I will check quietly and just share what I learned. I figured as long as I was not naming the source it was not breaking her rule.\n\nThe real argument happened recently when I suggested maybe the minor accident she got into along with one from last year might have had something to do with what she was wearing while driving. She often wears long skirts and sandals with thin soles or heels. I checked if that could be a safety issue and when I brought it up with her she asked where I got the info. I was honest and said I looked it up. She got really upset and said I was being disrespectful and ignoring what she had already told me not to do.\n\nShe has been cold and distant since and I honestly do not think I did anything wrong. I was not using anything to argue or belittle her, just to get answers I was curious about. AITA",

      "title": "AITA for turning down music at someone else’s house while my baby tried to sleep?",
      "body": "ETA: this was Sunday night. We stayed Saturday-Monday (today). Four hours from my parent’s house. No other rooms were available. It was NOT a party, this was a weekend fishing trip. \n\nI (28F) and my husband (28M) are on vacation visiting my parents out of state with our 1.5 year old son. It is his first big trip with a long plane ride, time difference, and unfamiliar surroundings. Adjusting has been hard, but he is doing his best. I am also early pregnant with our second child.\n\nI try hard not to let my child be an inconvenience to others or expect people to adjust their lives around him. That is especially difficult when we are not home, where he has his toys, snacks, food, and familiar routine. He thrives on structure, and so do I.\n\nThis weekend, we stayed at a friend of my parents’ for some outdoor activities. There were nine adults total and just one toddler, mine.\n\nAt 8:45 p.m., I laid my son down in a pack and play in our room. He fussed a little, so after five minutes I went back to soothe him. By 9 p.m., he was quiet. The room was dark and his sound machine was on.\n\nThis family eats late, and while setting the table, someone began clattering silverware loudly on the countertops. The room we were staying in was directly above the kitchen, which has an open balcony-style ceiling. My son woke up crying around 9:30. I went back upstairs to soothe him.\n\nWhile I was rocking him, someone started playing 80s music downstairs. At first I did not think much of it, but the volume was turned up, and a group of women including my mother started singing and laughing loudly. I texted my husband asking if he could have them turn the music down. He replied, “He is going to be fine.” I said he was not falling asleep and that I was the one in the room. He said, “It is not that loud.”\n\nI cracked the door and realized the speaker was directly below our room. I waited for the song to end so I could lay him down in a quiet moment, but they restarted the same song at full volume and continued singing. I waited for another pause, laid my son down awake, and went downstairs. I calmly said I was turning the music down because it was directly under our room and keeping him from sleeping. Some adults agreed, but others made comments about me ruining the mood. I should add the speaker had been set to maximum volume.\n\nFeeling emotional and frustrated, I gave my husband the monitor and went quietly to the basement to calm down and cry without making a scene. He came down 15 to 20 minutes later and told me I was overreacting. He said our son has slept through louder noises and that I was being unreasonable. I reminded him there is a difference between sleeping through something and trying to fall asleep with it. He dismissed me, said I was not going to change his mind, and left.\n\n5-10 minutes later I came upstairs. One of the homeowners apologized for waking my son, which I appreciated. But the others, many of whom were drunk, made exaggerated jokes about whispering so they would not wake the baby. At that point I decided not to eat and went to bed around 10:15.",

      "title": "AITA for calling out my kids’ future stepmom for treating me like a surrogate?",
      "body": "I [29F] dated a guy Joe (30M) for 3 months before he left me to go back to his ex Kim (30F). Right after we broke up I found out I was pregnant and now I’m at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. Turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally and he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us so he’s still with his girlfriend. \n\nJoe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of COVID-19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe when he told Kim she had a mental breakdown about her infertility, and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children’s stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her Mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the best choices for my children and my body and left. \n\nKim continued to be overbearing and texting me everyday about my eating habits, exercise habits, and bitching about how her job wouldn’t let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment, she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history which wasn’t relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins “the non-traditional way” and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn’t even invited. She also announced that she’s having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, that the kids weren’t hers, and that Joe didn’t have any claim or custody of the kids until they are born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went to family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. He and Kim and some of her friends and family are saying I’m an asshole and her mother even called and insisted I give her one of my babies like this is the Parent Trap? So AITA?\n\nEDIT: I’m definitely getting a lawyer ASAP. Y’all have scared the shit out of me but I’m happy you did.\n\nUPDATE: I never considered that this could’ve happened on purpose. We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non-hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police and they stated that there was nothing they could do because a crime hadn’t been committed. In my state orders of protection are criminal or family so I was able to get one against Joe. On Friday, I did get a lawyer and they let me know in my state there was nothing I could do as far as custody before the babies are born, so I will be leaving my state soon to ensure that this isn’t my babies home state and I can’t be charged with anything. \nHowever, someone sent this post to Kim and she came to my job, damaged my car, and broke a bunch of office windows. I work with kids so she was arrested for not just the criminal damage and trespassing but also child endangerment so hopefully that works in my favor. Also if Joe did it on purpose, I don’t think Kim knew, because she was screaming at me about how I stole her life and everything I had was supposed to be hers.\n\nUpdate: I have orders of protection against both Kim and Joe. I left the state anyway and Joe and Kim started harassing me again because there’s no legal jurisdiction when you leave the state, but I have enough evidence that I was able to press charges in my current state as well and will be pursuing a restraining order here.",

      "body": "3 Friends and I went to a bar in a popular part of town.  We got a patio table and I went to the bar and ordered the first round of drinks.  As I was walking back to our table, a dog jumped up and started barking.  I jumped about a mile high. I dropped a drink.  The owner quickly controls his dog, apologizes, and turns away from me. I tell the guy that i'm expecting a new drink from him.  \n\nI drop the other 3 drinks off at our table and go back and demand the guy to buy me a new drink.  In my mind this was not my fault and the dog owner was at a fault.  He says he won't do that and I should be more aware of my surroundings.  I'm livid. I call him a piece of shit.   I tell him if his dog can't ignore me as I walk by, then his dog shouldn't be here.  He tells me I should find somewhere that doesn't allow dogs.  Calls me an asshole and tells me to leave them alone. I drop it, complained to the bar, but they did nothing.  \n\nI'm just baffled by the lack of accountability here.  I don't mind dogs, but I didn't like being scared like that.  AITA?   \n",

      "title": "AITA for not defending my friend when my fiancé was mean to her.",
      "body": "I 26m have been engaged to my fiancé Zaira 26f for six months now. We were friends in highschool and only started dating when we were around 22. We were close in highschool( we were in the same friend group) but drifted apart and reconnected in uni so it’s safe to say I do know her really well. She’s a kind person most of the time. However she knows how to cut deep when the situation warrants it. I’ve witnessed it at times and she can make people cry. \n\nSo one of my friend groups mostly consists of gamers. I don’t hangout  with them in person that much because I’m not very social and prefer spending time with my fiancé. Even during calls I’m mostly muted or don’t talk but I do enjoy their company, I guess I’m just shy. My friends know I have a fiancé and they invited her out with us last night. There are girls in our friend group like two of them and this other girl in our group who can be a bit of a pick me girl. I’ll call her emma. She gets along well with the rest of us but sometimes she can be a bit annoying. \n\nSo last night we all went out to dinner and the other two girls and my girl were getting along really well. They really hit it off until Emma joined us later in the evening. She started of making passive aggressive backhanded comments to Zaira who intially just rolled her eyes and laughed but I told Emma to stop because I didn’t want the night to end with someone crying. She took this as a joke but stopped messing with Zaira for a while and then she started up again. I think she was trying make my fiancé insecure or jealous or something but Emma kept saying how close we are because we game. Zaira knows I’m not close with her because every time I play with them she is either in my lap or right next to me watching me play. Emma told Zaira not to worry about her because she wasn’t going to take me away from her. Zaira smiled at her and I knew the night was over. She looked Emma up and down and said ‘you, take him from me? Good luck.’ Emma tried defending herself and brushing it off as a joke but Zaira just kind of let loose I guess. She called Emma a pathetic excuse of a woman and asked if she needs male validation that desperately or if she’s actually deluded enough to think she(Emma) is more important than her (Zaira) in my life, among other things. I’m not going to lie, I do kind of think it’s hot when she gets like this so I just sat by and watched and Emma started crying and we left after she said thank you to the rest of my friends. \n\nThe girls in my group have been messaging me and saying I should’ve stopped Zaira and maybe not have let her be so rude and Emma has gone radio silent. My other friends think Zaira is justified and I do too but did she take it too far and should I have stopped her? Aita \n\nHi, so I have no idea how to update so I'm just going to write it here and hopefully people will read it. I wanna thank everyone who told me I wasn't an a-hole and neither was zaira. I knew we weren't wrong I just wanted an unbiased opinion. A lot people seem to think that zaira is a horrible woman who kicks puppies or something. I said that she can make people cry and everyone just assumed she just regularly goes out and makes people cry. She's made like three people cry, four if you count Emma but I'm 100% certain those were crocodile tears. Also my other friends in the group have decided they want some space from Emma and the other girls. Alot of people said zaira is trying to isolate me when it's in fact the opposite, if it wasn't for her I wouldn't even have these friends because I frankly have no interest in making a lot of friends. I also said that I think that zaira is hot when she gets assertive and stands up for herself and so many people were acting like I said something so gross and disgusting which was weird, like I'm sorry I think my fiancee is hot. Do you want me to hate her or something?\n\nOnto the update. We spent the morning reading the comments (it's her day off) and zaira thinks you're all kind and funny. I've decided I'm just going to put some distance between myself and the girls. I have other friends so I'll be fine. Plus were getting married in November so I have better things to worry about and look forward to. I actually cannot wait,these two months are taking forever.🥲",

      "body": "THROW AWAY for obvious reasons. \n\nUPDATE - in comments :)  and cat tax is \nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/HJtx6Jh\n\nBackground. I (30f) lived with a longtime friend (30m). We lived together for 6 years and known each other for 20 years (close families)  He was very accepting that I came with a cat, I paid for everything and legally owned her. He adored her though and would spend hours cuddling her.  I owned everything, all the furniture and the white goods because I had lived out of home before but he had not.\n\nHe got a GF at the 3.5 year mark and she practically moved in immediately. I still paid half the rent though. She was always very rude to me and clearly didn't want me alone with my friend.  There was only one lounge, attached to the kitchen, so he and I would previously watch TV together or just be in the same room while another cooked, worked etc. When she moved in that 'had to stop' because I was interfering with their couple time. Her attitude towards me got worse over time and my friend started treating me badly. They would leave sex toys all over the place, watch movies late and loud when my  bedroom was right there, glare at me if I cooked during their couple time even though they hogged the TV between 4-9pm.\n\nI got a bf and started spending a lot of time with him.  After this things got worse.  My friend began locking my cat in small cages and putting her the shower. He also began talking differently to me and leave the kitchen in a absolute mess (mould) to make it difficult for me to cook. I found used condoms in the lounge.  It then got to the stage where we wouldn't talk but all the tormenting was still going on.\n\nI decided to leave and started looking for somewhere else.  The lease was up in 4 months but we had not discussed what we wanted to do. I found out through his sister (and a close friend of mine) that they had been saving up this whole time to move out and would be moving in a few weeks'. This was news to me. I couldn't afford the rent by myself.\n\nI found a place before they did, spoke to the estate agent and advised them of the situation - turns out he had not been paying his full share of the rent and she was not listed as living there. The agent did not hold me accountable for any of it.  I paid 4 weeks' leave before I left. I didn't tell them when I was leaving and on a day when they were not home my friends helped me pack up and leave.  The house was cleaned spotless.  I also took all of my furniture, whitegoods and kitchenware - so basically everything but his room! I took my cat.\n\nAfter I left I received hundreds of missed calls and messages from them abusing me for not notifying them and taking everything and MY cat. Most of his family also messaged me telling me what an AH I am. My parents knew what I was doing, supported me but have also called me an AH because our families are still not exactly on speaking terms.",

I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   \n\nThis friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  \n\nI backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?  ",

      "body": "I (18F) live at home and split time between my divorced parents — about 3 weeks with each. Lately, my mom and I have been getting into frequent small arguments, and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed.\n\nWe’ve always clashed a bit. My mom can be really controlling: she wants to know every detail when I go out, constantly reminds me about things I already do (like flossing), and is really strict about money. When I had a children's bank account, she would literally check it daily and question me about any spending. She has a decent income, owns a nice apartment, and her parents (my grandparents) are wealthy, so I don’t fully understand why she’s so stressed about money all the time.\n\nOne recurring fight is over how long I shower. I wash my hair twice a week, which takes me around 25–30 minutes total. I even turn the water off while conditioner or a hair mask is sitting — a habit I actually learned from her! Still, she knocks on the door to complain, saying I take too long. Today it happened again, and we got into another fight. She thinks 2-minute showers (sometimes even without soap!) are fine, and worries about the water bill.\n\nI’ve told her that I’m not being wasteful and that I literally can’t shower faster given my routine. When I bring up how she’s being too controlling, she gets defensive and says she’s just being a normal parent. I’ve also told her that I’d rather live more with my dad since he’s much more relaxed and not so critical — but I can tell that hurts her feelings. She gets sad when I say stuff like that, and I don’t want to upset her, but I also feel like I have a right to speak up since I spend so much time living with her.\n\nSo... AITA for calling her controlling and saying I’d rather live with my dad?",

In the 2 years we've been living together, I do practically all the chores around the house and I try to treat her to like a queen when she comes back home. However, the one thing I can't do is be a handyman no matter how easy the task is. A few months ago, the bathroom door hinges needed replacing so I called a friend to help.\n\nLast week during lunch with her parents, I asked her dad about the project he was working on (he does woodworking as a hobby). He showed me the progress on his phone and suggested I should help him with the last touches.\n\nMy girlfriend told him that I can't even replace door hinges let alone help with that. Her mom said that every man should know how to fix things around the house and her husband agreed with her. The remainder of lunch was very awkward, it was like they were my real parents and were disappointed of me for being a huge failure.\n\nAfter we left, I told my girlfriend that I didn't expect their reaction. Instead of taking my side, she said that they were right because it was embarrassing that I need to call a friend to help with something trivial.\n\nI reminded her that I get nervous and anxious everytime I touch a tool. I admitted it was stupid but it's just the way I am and has been very honest with her since the start. Still she didn't change her mind.\n\nI told her that since their idea of being a man is twisted I must share the same view and start working on being their version of a man. I told her that I will stop cooking for her. And I'll stop doing the dishes, laundry and cleaning. The only thing that I would keep doing is taking the trash out and grocery shopping.

      "body": "I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're \"crunchy parents\" to a 8 month old.\n\nBasically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea.\n\nOn Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing. \n\nWhen I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and \"threw out anything I don't need\". This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us.\n\nI was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items.\n\nMy brother thinks I'm being a massive asshole and he's on his wifes side. Our parents think im being completely reasonable here but they think telling her essentially not to come back is taking it too far. AITA?",

      "body": "I (m18) am a soccer referee. I have officiated since 2020 and have played soccer for 12 years now. \n\nI have been wondering about this for a while now.\n\nLast weekend, I was officiating a few games for U10 boys. For ages 10 and under in the select league I was reffing, there is a special set of rules. There is a line called the “build-out line”, and it is essentially a line on both ends of the field (about 10 yards in front of the goalkeeping box). So long as you are behind the line, it does not matter where the players on the opposing team are. You can be past the defenders but not pass the build-out line, and score. In an older age group, offside would apply and this would not be allowed.\n\nHowever, this is very clearly written in the rules and in the last game I reffed, one of the kids on the blue team scored 3 goals this way. Behind the last defender, but not passing the build out line, so they all counted. \n\nEvery time, some dad from the team that was losing kept screaming that I had no idea what I was doing and that every one of the goals was offside. I heard one of the parents say “it’s onside because of the buildout lines”, but it was very quiet. The dad continued to shout but I ignored him, and the game finished with his team losing 6-0. At the end, he was swearing to a bunch of the parents on his side, and I heard him say “this ref is fking terrible”\n\nI walked over to him after I blew my whistle and said “every one of those goals was legal because of the buildout line rules. You should consider learning the rules of the sport before you sign up your own child and swear in front of a bunch of kids.”\n\nHe looked like he was about to explode. Some of the parents looked angry too and his little circle went quiet. He started clapping sarcastically and said “way to keep it professional, sir”. I then left.\n\nI told my parents and my mother laughed. My father told me I shouldn’t bother associating with people like that and it makes me stoop to their level. \n\nAita?\n\nEdit: should have clarified, build out lines are a rule for the league I was officiating. It is not an outstanding rule in soccer for all leagues. I should have worded that better, apologies",

      "body": "My boyfriend grew up in a house that valued outdated gender norms. The women were always responsible for cooking and cleaning, so he didn't learn how to do any of that for most of his life. That is, until he moved in with me after college. \n\nHe's been good about a few things. He doesn't mind helping with dishes or handling the laundry, but the one thing I can't seem to get him to do is learn how to cook. The only thing he can do is microwave frozen meals. I've been trying to teach him the basics, but it seems like it goes through one ear and just comes out the other. He still can't turn on the oven or use the stove without help. The toaster is too complicated for him to use he claims.  Doesn't know how to boil eggs, cook rice, or even how to measure out ingredients using cups. I just don't understand why he can't grasp this but is fine with other things. \n\nHere's the part where I may be an asshole. I went on a trip two weeks ago for work. I'm in charge of buying groceries (we have separate accounts) and I realized how expensive his frozen meals actually are. Three to four dollars for each. I said screw it and bought the easiest ingredients I could find for a lot cheaper for him to cook on his own. He doesn't like leftovers, so me cooking ahead for him was out. Before I left, I sat him down once again and gave him a very long lesson on using the oven, toaster, and stove, as well as how to boil/scramble eggs, toast a piece of toast, boil rice/noodles, and heat up pasta sauce. I also taught him how to pan fry things like onions and other veggies, and how to tell when they were ready. In case he didn't want to cook both lunch and dinner, I also bought things to make salads and fixings for sandwiches. \n\nI come back a week later, and he is angry! He claims I practically left him to starve, and how I know he has trouble cooking. I retaliate, saying I showed him what to do, and I get a whole range of excuses. \"Setting the oven/stove temp is too complicated\" \"He cut his finger chopping onions and couldn't chop any until his cut healed\" \"He only likes the salad kits so everything is balanced\" \n\nApparently he only ate sandwiches, canned goods, and fast food for a week. He thinks I'm a major asshole for not telling him I'm not buying his frozen meals, and leaving him alone to fend for himself. On one hand, I do think it was shitty of me not to tell him I didn't buy his meals, and as someone who grew up in a home pretty much only boiled hotdogs and veggies, and only properly learned how to cook after moving, out I do feel for him, but at the same time, after a few months of not getting the simplest concepts, I'm left feeling partially justified in my actions. So Reddit, AITA?",

I can't drain my retirement fund since I need it to retire. \n\n\nI have three kids, they all decided to go to expensive colleges. I paid for their books, and gave them money for food plan but tuition was on them. They knew from the beginning that college would be on them.\n\nMy youngest took some community college classes that to save money. The rest of the kids didn't do much to lower their expensives. They are all out of college and a whole bunch of debt. \n\nMy mother passed away and she gave me the house. I am selling it for around 500k. I plan use some of it for a big vacation and then the rest to go into my retirement fund.\n\nI decided to let the kids have a look at the home first before it went on the market. It's a really nice area and the house is great. They were suprised by the amount and all of them couldn't afford it. I told them I plan to sell it soon.\n\nThis started argument about how I came into so much money put don't plan to give them any of it. I told them it is my inheritance from my mother. She wanted me to have this.\n\nArgument escalated even more and they want me to pay of their school debt. If I did that I it would take 3/4 of my inheritance. So I told them no. I reminded them that when I die they will have their own inheritance from me but I am not dead yet.\n\nThey at pissed at me",

      "body": "I (40M) just got off a long flight, the kind where even the comfiest seats feel like torture racks. Now, I'm a big dude. Not yet book 2 seats level, but enough for plane seats to be absolute hell. Booked a window seat, figured the extra space would help..\n\nThe flight attendant assigns a woman to the middle seat. Nice person, we exchanged greetings, no problem. Here's where things get tricky. Nature called a couple of times during the flight, and let's just say squeezing by in that cramped space is an exercise in contortionism at the best of times. The woman in the middle seat politely refused to get up whenever I needed to use the restroom. (The lady in the aisle seat was very accommodating and would get up any time either I or the lady in the middle needed to get up)\n\nNow, I get it. Nobody wants some sweaty dude brushing past them. I tried my best to minimize contact, literally sucked in my gut and held my breath like I was underwater . But even with all the contorting, there was some unavoidable brushing past.\n\nAt the end of the flight, the woman makes a passive-aggressive comment about \"personal space\" and how uncomfortable I made her feel throughout the flight. Honestly, I felt terrible. Didn't mean to make her feel that way, but what else was I supposed to do? Hold it for 8 hours? Ask her to physically get up? (Since she repeatedly didn't get up and indicated I should squeeze by, I had no reason to think she was too bothered by it)\n\nAITA for making her uncomfortable?",

We have been together for almost two years. \nPretty much this weekend my family was staying near us and i went to go hang out with them at their airbnb. My place is about 20 minutes from my family’s airbnb so it wasn’t that far out of the way, this is important for later. \nSo i ended up meeting up with them around 3pm and texted my bf the addy in case he also wanted to meet up. Me and my bf had been talking about this for a couple days so it was no surprise when i invited him. \nHe texted me back at like 5 saying that he was gonna come over, i was super excited my family loves him and it would just be nice to spend quality time. So as we continue through the night is silence i haven’t heard from him since and it was about 9 o’clock and that is when i started to go nuclear. pretty much i spammed him with texts along the lines of if you can’t keep your word i don’t know what else you can. Sending a lot of texts asking are you coming or not, “stop making me look like a dumbass” bc i told everyone he was coming and people are constantly asking. \nand this has happened before but i must preface this i had been drinking for the past 4 hours im not a regular drinker so i was very close to my end. He had been playing music with his friends for the whole time and thats why he didn’t respond. which is understand he was doing his own thing and having a good time but how long would it take to sent a simple text just letting me know he wasn’t coming. \nI know im definitely in the wrong for how i responded to the situation like fr i sent voicemails texts it was really bad. I took accountability for all of that and owned up to my actions and that was a wrong way to respond to how i was feeling. But now i feel like im the one who’s apologizing and he just keeps putting it in my face that i am making him depressed. And i just dont know if he gets why i was upset. And we haven’t had an actual face to face conversation about everything and he was planning to\ncome over today. But idk ",

      "body": "I (F, early 30s) live in Houston, TX with my husband and our twin toddlers. Both my husband and I are super busy — I go to community college and work hourly at HEB, and he’s working a full-time job that's been unstable (he’s had a few close-call layoffs). We're constantly juggling work, school, and the twins’ summer activities, so life is a bit chaotic. We are recent immigrants to TX.\n\nMy cousin (22M) is a senior in undergrad. He and his brother who is joining for undergrad studies as well, are planning a vacation trip soon before start of school year, and he asked me to help him find cheap housing in Dallas. I don't know much about bookings. I really wanted to help — we've known each other since we were kids, and when he first moved to the U.S. (he came here in high school), we supported him a lot, including with housing and settling in. Culturally (we’re Indonesian), family tends to help each other with this kind of thing and my cousins are young and new to U.S.\n\nBut my husband knew about this request and said no - he thinks the cousin should be handling this himself by now. My husband thinks it's our time, and I spending any little time will be less time for our own family, my study, and my twins. He even messaged my cousin’s family directly to say they should be responsible for their own plans. Now the optic about my husband is that he is cold and unwilling to help family. He’s frustrated that we’re being asked for help again, and he feels like we don’t have the bandwidth anymore. I get where he’s coming from: we’re not in a position to spare much time or energy, but I still want to help my cousin out of love and family loyalty.\n\nWe argued over it. My husband says I’m being too soft and taking on more than I should, and that I’m not prioritizing our own family. I feel like he’s being a bit cold about it, especially since I’ve always tried to support his family too.\n\nSo… AITA for wanting to help my cousin plan his trip, even though it’s stressing my husband out?",

      "body": "I’m a teen female interning at a theater, where I’m the youngest. I often end up with the younger kids rather than other interns my age. Two years ago, I met a girl, S (now 6), who became really attached to me. I didn’t mind—we’d hug before I left or sit together during singing time, and everyone seemed fine with it.\nThis summer, I’ve been assigned to play music from the booth because I applied late. S was upset at first since we only see each other during snack and lunch, but she’s adjusted. We have a small ritual where I hold her hand walking into the theater and carry her a few feet to her seat before heading to the booth.\nAs show days approached, staff started filling the booth, so I moved to the wings. One day, a staff member, I, told me, “Hey, you know they don’t want you holding S anymore?” I was shocked—no one had said anything before. I just nodded and left for lunch. Earlier, S had asked for my phone number to give to her mom. Wanting to babysit and thinking it was harmless, I gave it to her. After lunch, as I was leaving, another staff member, R (who apparently has an issue with me holding S), snapped her fingers at me and started, “So with S, boundaries—” I cut her off saying, “Oh yeah, I already told me,” which I regret because I was embarrassed because she’d started talking about this in front of staff and kids. She just nodded and told me to have a good day. That night, I got five texts from S (from her mom’s phone). At first, I was happy, thinking I could finally connect with her mom for babysitting. But now I’m overthinking. S loves bragging, so I worry she’ll tell her friends she has my number, it’ll spread, and staff—especially R—will think I crossed a line. There’s no handbook for interns about boundaries, so I’m unsure if I did something wrong by giving my number to a kid.\n\nDid I cross a line, or am I just overthinking?\n\nEDIT: S is texting me from her mom’s phone so her mom clearly knows about this because she wouldn’t let S text a random number for no reason. I’ve also seen stuff about respecting S’s parents and her parents haven’t said anything about not wanting me to be in contact with S. Additionally, when I interact with the other kids, I do the same with them. I would give them a hug (they initiate ofc) goodbye or a wave if they don’t want a hug. The staff knows this and thinks it’s fine, and other interns do this as well.",

The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH\"s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. \n\nI have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.\n\nShe said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more \"girly\". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH\"s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. \n\nI paid for all the dresses. \n\nFast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.\n\nSo fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. \n\nI confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. \n\nThe wedding went on and it was truly amazing.\n\nEver since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",

I’ve had my drivers license for about 3,5 years so before getting my own car I used to borrow my moms or my grandmas car if public transport wasn’t an option. So a few weeks ago in june my mom wanted to borrow my car, which of course was fine. My car can pull her caravan, her own car can’t so we switched cars for the weekend. Saturday afternoon she called me: she had lost my key and asked me if I could bring the spare one. She was only 15 minutes away, so fine, I went. The day went on and Sunday morning I went to see her. When I was there, someone returned my car key to my mom. She was very happy it was found, but this was also the moment she decided to tell me that she also lost my spare key. MY car keys, TWO in 24 HOURS… I ofcourse was not happy to hear she had lost the second key in only a day.\n\nFlash forward to Sunday evening, she told me that she found the key, drove my car home and LOST IT AGAIN. THIRD key in two days. I am really pissed off at this, so that was also the moment that I decided for myself that I would not lend my car to my mom anymore. (I should add here that the key was found again, so I still have both keys)\n\nI feel like I’m the asshole because my mom keeps telling me I’m overreacting. Am I? She told me she was under a lot of stress that weekend, which I totally get. But for me thats valid if she had lost it once, but three times??? My grandma took her side, because they let me use their cars for years before I got my own. Which I’m very grateful for!\n\nAlso, my mom has gotten to the point where I can’t even borrow a hat or something small out of spite.\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nPs, please excuse any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.",

      "body": "My daughter (14) had anxiety problems ever since she was little but it was not severe. 3 months ago, my daughter changed drastically. She stopped eating, talking to us or her friends and her marks dropped. We were really concerned and her teachers strongly suggested we take her to therapy which we did and she was diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety which was expected.\n\nThe therapy sessions look like they helped her well, in the first month she already began making progress and started talking to us and her friends again and is eating whatever her mother is cooking. We were really happy to see this and every day she would get better and better. The thing is, her marks did not. They are terrible and she ended up barely passing the year. This is what infuriated me and made me cancel her therapy sessions. I know to some it might sound terrible, but paying $120 per session and seeing no progress in her marks makes me feel like I am seriously wasting my money (now that she returned back to normal). Not only that but since she really enjoys going to therapy I think telling her that she needs to get higher marks to continue her therapy sessions will motivate her to study harder and thus score better marks.\n\nMy wife disagrees with my logic and we had a massive argument because of it which ended up with her saying that she is going to pay from ‘her money’ which hurt me since I see my and her money as ours. My daughter is also really upset on me and was begging me to keep her therapy sessions but I think I am going to stick to this plan. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I deeply apologize for my ignorant replies and for hurting so many people. Please know that I had no intention in offending anyone and it was so upsetting to see how mental illness has affected many of you. I hope you guys can overcome this one day. I have talked to my wife and her therapy sessions will continue.",

      "body": "AITA - My husband (41) and I (41) both work, we live in Silicon Valley. He makes 3x more than I do but I have to work and contribute as much of my income as possible to household expenses. He pays for most things and I am expected to do all the things involving caring for him, the kids, our home, etc. \n\nMy daughter asked for a party at home this year for her (9) birthday. She wanted a sleepover but all her friends' parents said the girls weren't ready for that. So with my husband's advice I planned an evening sleepover themed party. \n\nAs I was planning I came across really cute tepee style tents with air mattresses that I thought would be perfect. My husband was totally against it. He felt like having a party at home should be done cheap. In previous years we've spent anywhere from $500 to $1000 on parties for the kids. The tepees cost $250, and I bought decor for around an additional $100. He demanded I throw them away immediately following the party because he didn't want them piling up in the garage. In total we spent about $500 on her party. The final straw for him was our daughter asking to go to a Disney Concert after we started planning her party and he knew we were going to do it for her. As a result he flipped out.\n\nI responded with a few things: he was being very mean and negative about every part of our daughter's birthday and towards our kids in general, he has had hundreds of dollars worth of large expensive Lego sets sitting in boxES in our dining room UNOPENED for YEARS, and it was a turn off (because he was demanding \"spicy time\" in exchange for getting things for our daughter's party). \n\nThe result, he hasn't spoken to me in days. He's denying giving me the silent treatment, but he's been quiet, moping, and isolating himself. He didn't even speak to or spend time with our daughter on her birthday. He locked himself in our room and had my son bring him drinks and food all night during her party. Now the party is behind us and I know he deliberately did that to avoid having to pay for anything else in hopes the party and something would fail so he could say \"I told you so \". Or prove without  his money we would have nothing and that's why we should be more appreciative of him. \n\nAITAH, but also is what I said and did genuinely being ungrateful of my husband?  ",

      "body": "This happened a couple weeks ago but I'm still getting shit about it.\n\nA friend of mine Daya (fake name) asked me if I wanted to come with her on some errands and see her new car. I said yes because I had some things to get done and my car was being checked over. (We're in the same bubble and stayed masked the whole time)\n\nWell while we were out Daya ended up hitting another car while turning left. We were both shaken but mostly fine yet but when I started to call the police Daya started freaking out even more. She started begging me not to call the cops and to just go talk to the other driver. I didn't feel comfortable not calling them so I went ahead and did. Then Daya started begging me to get in the driver's seat, saying I had to get in the driver's seat, I had to claim I was the one driving. Turns out Daya doesn't have a license. She needed/wanted a car but didn't feel like getting her license so her mom bought the car for her.\n\nI didn't feel comfortable lying to the police so I continued to refuse and just got out of the car and waited on the sidewalk for them to get there. Well Daya got arrested for driving without a license, insurance, or registration for her car and just told me today she has been found at fault for the accident.\n\nNow Daya, her mom, and half of our friends are saying I'm an asshole for not just switching places. She is now facing multiple fines, possible jail time, and being kicked out of our MA program because of all this. I tried to explain that I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police but she just keeps calling me a \"privileged bitch\" and wishing horrible things would happen to me.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not switching places with her?\n\nEdit: Several people have said I should include this and I'm sorry I didn't in the original post. This was much more serious than a fender bender. This was my response to someone else: \"She took the entire front of his car off or at least it looked like it. We were at an intersection and she was in a left turn lane with a yellow light and didn't look before she went. The other gentleman was coming the opposite way going straight. Both cars are totaled.\" The gentleman was not unconscious as I originally thought but he did hit his head on the steering wheel and he had to be taken to the hospital. He did eventually get out of his car with help and that's when I believe I should have talked to him. Daya and I were mostly alright with just some bumps and bruises.\n\nEdit 2: Someone suggested I add this because of people saying I am the asshole for calling the police but for major accident such as this one where I live you are required by law to call the police and file a report.",

In our country and particularly our city, housekeepers are in very high demand, especially ones from the same region of our country as Vivian is because they have the best food in the country.\n\nMy brother got divorced a year ago and got very depressed, so I advised him to hire a housekeeper to help him maintain his daily tasks. She also helps him by babysitting his two daughters when it is his custody time when he is at work. \n\nI went grocery shopping a few weeks ago with my brother and he picked up a box of chocolates and some flowers for Vivian. He told me that she was sick and I thought it was very sweet of him. \n\nHowever, my nieces (my brothers daughters) told me that their father always hits on Vivian when she is working and he buys her expensive gifts. Then yesterday, he made an off handed comment about her body when she was bringing some foot to the table when I went to his home to have lunch with him. She laughed awkwardly and excused herself.\n\nI asked him what he was doing and basically, he is attracted to her. I told him that his behaviour with her was not appropriate as he is her employer and if he cannot behave, he should let her go. When he hired her, her agency said that there were many other families who wanted her because of resume so she will not be left jobless. I told him that she deserves to have a work place that is safe. \n\nHe was very upset and said I was treating him like a creep and it wasn’t my business. I left after this and he called me demanding an apology. I feel like I may have over stepped since he told me Vivian has not complained herself. I feel very bad now and I was wondering if I am AH.",

There are plenty of jobs around the area so that is not an issue. I made it clear I will help both of them to get a job, and when my son asked I helped him with his resume.\n\nSo her 16 birthday went and gone. She asked me where her allowance was and I reminded her that she isn’t getting one anymore. \n\nThis started an argument and she thinks I am jerk for doing this. My husband also thinks I should give in but I am not\n\nEdit: I am getting off, if you have a question I have many comments and it is probably in there.",

      "body": "I (28F) am 29 weeks pregnant with fraternal twins (a boy and a girl). I was lucky enough to get pregnant almost immediately after going off birth control. My SIL (38F), who I’ll call Jane, has fertility issues and has not been able to have a baby after more than a decade of trying and multiple rounds of IVF. \n\nA few days ago, my family all came over to my house to hang out. I told them that I finished decorating my nursery and my mom, sister, and other SIL all wanted to see it so I took them in to see it. Jane looked unhappy when I mentioned the nursery and said she’d rather not see it. She went out to the porch while we went inside. We stayed in the nursery for a while and eventually Jane came in because it was too hot outside. \n\nWe were talking about babies (sister and other SIL both have young children) and Jane looked a bit uncomfortable with the conversation. My sister said that I was really lucky to get pregnant with twins right after I started trying. After that, Jane started crying and left the room. We all went after her to talk to her and she said she feels awful having to constantly hear about our babies. \n\nShe went on a long rant about how she feels excluded because she’s the only one of us without a child now. She thinks our mom treats her like she’s less than my sister and other SIL because they have kids and now that I’m pregnant, we don’t talk about anything but kids. She said it’s insensitive when we know that she’s infertile. She was like this for all of my sister and SIL’s pregnancy. \n\nShe insists on coming to all the gender reveals and baby showers and birthday parties but spends all her time there wallowing in her misery and even starts crying sometimes. I kind of want to uninvite her from my baby shower next week because I’m scared she’ll ruin the vibe. WIBTA if I did that. I feel bad for her, but she can’t keep bringing negativity to all of our celebrations. I told my mom that I want to uninvite her and she said I shouldn’t because she’s family and we need to support her instead of excluding her even more. \n\nEdited to add paragraphs ",

Last summer, I bought the boys a small volleyball net. One day we’re out as a family playing volleyball and my son accidentally hit a floating ball over the fence which hits the neighbors house. (This side of has no windows) I, as I did when I was a kid suggested my son walk over apologize and ask for the ball back. By the time he made it to the front yard the neighbor 70ish man was outside asking to speak to me. I walked out front and noticed he was upset. He asked if we had no manners and said that we let our kids go wild at their expense. He suggested we pay closer attention to our kids. I explained we were playing as a family and it was an accident. He pivoted and complained about my kids playing soccer and hitting the shared fence. He brought up a time where my son cracked a fence board which I replaced days later. I gave in and told him we would move our activities to other parts of the yard so as not to bother them. No issues since.\n\nLast night we were enjoying time outside as a family again. My wife and I sitting on our deck and the boys playing soccer on the grass. (Opposite of cranky neighbors yard) the boys are playing and at one point the 12 y/o takes a shot that unluckily bounces off the raised deck hits their house and falls into their yard. We all looked at each other and knew exactly what was coming. We heard him go out back, grab the ball and he proceeded to walk around to our front door and knock. When I opened the door he had placed the balls on our door mat I said “oh thank you” he said “no, no thank you. That is the last time next time I call the police” I asked “for what? Kids playing in their yard” he said “that is two times now” I said “if you want to live somewhere away from people you should buy a house away from people” he said “no, no you” I responded with “well we are younger than you and we are staying here” at this point he walked away. I’m not concerned with him calling the cops since my kids have not damaged anything of his. We have no issues with any other neighbors they are super nice and if the boys hit a ball over they send it back eventually one neighbor (older woman). Brings them treats and enjoys hearing them outside. We have done all we can to avoid any of our activities affecting this man and his house. We stay away from his side at all costs but sometimes accidents happen. I felt bad last summer because my I got on my kids about this so much that it felt like they were walking on eggshells in their own yard. I’m at the point where I don’t want to deal with him, but I also want my kids to enjoy their yard. Obviously I want my kids to be careful of our neighbors property but, would I be the asshole if I let my kids just be kids and play freely in our yard and risk bothering cranky neighbor?",

She used it once that first year, twice last year and not at all this season.\n\nFast forward to now, I had an accident last weakened and managed to snap the end of my board (luckly came away uninjured) But the board is unusable. I do not have the money to buy a new board right now (to be clear, we live within reasonable driving distance to the snow, and I have friends that live down there, so aside from a season pass I pay very little to go).\n\nI asked my sister if it would be alright if I used her board (my old board) for the rest of the season, so I could save up until sale time to get a deal on a new board. She said not a chance, that she was actually planning to sell it for $100. I complained to our brother but he said I'm the one being unreasonable considering it's her board now, \"it's hers to do what she wants with\".\n\nLook, I get it, I gave it to her, and now it's hers.

      "body": "  I (54f) have a friend (55f) who went vegan 10 years ago. We’ve been friends 20 years or more. We have a large group of friends 15-20 and there are a few of us that switch off cooking dinner on Thanksgiving for whoever is in town. \nSince “Ann” went vegan we’ve always accommodated her dietary restrictions with at the very least some tofurkey, one side dish and one dessert being strictly vegan.  \n  This year Ann jumped in early and for the first time ever said she wanted to cook Thanksgiving this year. Not a problem. Until she informed us in the group chat dinner will be 100% vegan. Some of us offered to bring more omnivore offerings, including a turkey and she insisted we eat vegan while at her house. She declared that vegan food “tastes exactly the same” as omnivore food. It does not. I’ve been to her house and choked down bean burgers and chocolate cake and probably a dozen other meals each of which she insisted tasted just like the real thing. She even tried to fool me once with a beyond burger, insisting is was a regular hamburger. \n  I have only found a limited number of vegan dishes I enjoy and none of them have ever been made by her. \nAfter thinking it over and discussing it with my husband we decided to privately tell her we were bowing out of dinner on Thanksgiving this year. I told her I wanted turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie that were made with traditional ingredients. \n  I could have lied and said we had plans to travel to see family but I don’t want lie. \n  Ann has become angrier and angrier with me since I told her this about a week ago. Then she went and complained to some of the women in our group about me refusing to attend just because she’s cooking. \n\nWhich is sort of true but still made me angry. So I ended explaining to the other ladies that we all very considerately make vegan dishes just for her at every party and get together any of us throw and it’s really unreasonable for her to insist that I strictly adhere to her dietary choices when I have never demanded the same from her. \n\n  So that blew up because all the ladies have now jumped to my way of thinking and decided they will have Thanksgiving at one of their houses instead. (We will not be attending their Thanksgiving either)\n\n  My husband says we probably should have lied about going out of town or at the very least I should have not explained my reasoning to the other ladies. \n\n  I’ve decided to stay out of it from here on out but somehow Anna blames me for the whole debacle. AITA for declining to attended a vegan thanksgiving? ",

      "title": "AITA for grounding my daughter because she called my SIL a “slut”?",
      "body": "My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL’s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as “a vapid slut” and her husband “a pathetic cuck” along with other slurs I don’t want to repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that’s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister’s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I’m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We’re definitely concerned for our daughter about what’s happening at school and we’re looking into therapy.\n\nFor clarification, as for my SIL’s privacy, she didn’t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",

      "title": "AITA for not accepting my sister's relationship with my ex despite her having cancer as a teenager?",
      "body": "My (25F) father married my step-sister's (23F) mother when I was 4 and she was 3. We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close.\n\nShe developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.\n\nAnyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.\n\nI broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money.\n\nShe told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.\n\nFor the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me.\n\nNow no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about.\n\nThank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Sometimes you can only laugh. Just got off of the phone with my cousin who saw this post and said he could explain a few things. I asked him why he was on Reddit instead of school, he asked me why I was on Reddit instead of work, and I said touché. He told me that after my conversation with my mom, she went to his house and talked to my aunt. And here's the deal:\n\nTurns out my sister is not only in a relationship with Ben but **FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT**. Which means she and Ben were fucking for longer than I had even guessed. Apparently my parents are so adamant that I forgive her because I'm already ruining their experience of their first grandchild. That's right, I'm less important than my stepmom posting ultrasounds to Facebook. This is where we're at.\n\nAnyhow, I called out of work sick the rest of the day and am going to drink a lot of alcohol. Like, a lot of alcohol. And then start thinking about what the fuck I'm going to do.",

      "title": "AITAH for eating most of her birthday cake?",
      "body": "My wife (32f) and I (35m) were recently on vacation over the 4th of July, which also happens to be my wife's birthday. We had all the normal traditions for our family, including cake. We all had a piece day-of but almost nobody ate cake the entire rest of the trip. When the time came to return home, in-laws (MIL made the cake) offered to send the whole thing with us because they \"didn't need all that and we will probably just throw it away.\" My wife hates food waste, so she brought it. The journey home was two days by car. It has since been two additional days since we got back. Each night after dinner, I've had a reasonably sized piece of the cake for desert. I used to be a bigger guy and while I have much better habbits now, I still have a soft spot for baked goods...the cake was \"budgeted for\" though and I had been looking forward to eating a little. Well today my wife saw that there was only one slice left and was irate... Saying I was completely selfish and had eaten almost all of HER cake. I told her the cake had been available to all for nearly a week (counting days it sat on the counter before we took it home with us) and that nobody had bothered to touch it but me. I did apologize after she finished explaining to me that it upset her but I dont understand why it's such a big deal to begin with. The cake was right there...she never even had a bite.\n\nFor additional context, in the past she has requested that certain foods be saved for her as leftovers etc. Ive obliged, only for that food to sit until it had become moldy and she claims she \"forgot it was in there, oops.\" For someone who hates food waste, allegedly, I find this behavior doubly puzzling... Was I wrong here?\n\nEdit to answer some recurring questions:\n\nIt isn't, nor has ever been a \"my cake\" or \"your cake\" situation in our family. Its just THE cake, to be shared. There has never been an expectation beyond making sure the birthday person gets the first slice. After that, its just a regular old cake.\n\nThe courtesy some are relaying is to simply ask if she wanted a slice while im serving myself. In our home, this has never really been a consistent thing. It does happen, but its not an expectation and doesnt happen every time. Desserts are just understood to be periodically available and if you want some, its there. Different rules for small children notwithstanding...\n\nFinally...we ate on the drive. Idk why people exclude those two days from when the cake was available. Obviously we didn't drive 48 hours straight without sustenance... and the first night we obviously had to park and rest somewhere. And besides that we were home for dinner on the second day as well.\n\nUpdate: I have decided to simply bake her the exact same cake, in a smaller tin just for her. It will be her cake and nobody else will touch it. If it gets wasted, so be it. I hate the waste but its not worth the division.\n\nUpdate 2: the remade cake was much appreciated. She has yet to take a single bite. Not going to track progress. The cake was made as an apology, not to test the theory. This is the final update. ",

      "body": "I want to start by saying I’ve never posted on Reddit before but this situation has left me so unsure of myself. If I do something wrong let me know. Thank you for your thoughts!!\n\nI (27M) am getting married in October and my fiancée (28F) just had her bridal shower. It was relatively small (only 12 people including myself and my soon to be bride). She invited her close family, a couple friends, and my mom and sister. She did invite her own father (who is almost 80) because she wants him to be apart of these important events and he was a last minute addition on the day of the shower. She did not invite my dad because traditionally the groom’s father is not invited. She thought about inviting my stepmom but decided not to since my biological mother would be there. This would have been very awkward for everyone there. My dad and mom had a messy divorce that still plagues our lives (as you can see). My fiancée is much closer with my biological mother and wanted her to be comfortable. \n\nSome background, my dad and stepmom live 12 hours away. My fiancée has met my dad once and has NEVER met my stepmom. My stepmom is also an incredibly anxious person who hates flying and could not drive the 12 hours alone. Thank you to everyone who responds! \n\nEdit: my biological mother’s partner was also not invited to the shower. Additionally, my father is barely in my life. He will send me money occasionally but that is the extent of it. He has the means to visit me whenever but has not done that in more than 10 years. \n\nEdit 2: my dad and stepmom are upset about not being invited to the bridal shower. He texted me the day after asking why. I responded with our reasons (listed above) and he responded with “any  response other than ‘we’re sorry we should have handled it differently’ is bullshit. All the stuff you sent in your text is bullshit and made everything 10x worse.” He also called me a dick for these reasons and has brought up divorce issues that are between him and my mother. \n\nI also want to say, I WASN’T EVEN INVITED TO HIS WEDDING TO MY NOW STEPMOM. They did not invite any of his children to their wedding which was small and during the school year but still! ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to financially support my sister because she chose to become a single mother?",
      "body": "I (32M) have a sister, Emily (34F), who has always wanted to be a mother, but she hasn't been able to find the right partner. After years of waiting, I suggested she consider IVF treatment. I even helped her research the process and find clinics. She loved the idea and decided to go ahead with it.\n\nEmily had the financial means to afford IVF on her own, but it meant she had to cut back on creature comforts and luxuries for the foreseeable future. Two months ago, after her fourth round of treatment, she got pregnant. The whole family is very happy for her and she's happy too. She didn't expect it to take so many rounds of treatment, though, so the bill ended up higher than she was prepared for. She does have enough money to support herself, but not very comfortably. She asked our family for help so she wouldn’t have to make even more sacrifices. Our parents are retired and living on a fixed income so they can't contribute much. This leaves me as her main source of potential financial support.\n\nLast week Emily sat me down and asked me for money. I have no issue with people choosing to be single parents if they can afford it. But I don't believe it's fair to ask others to finance such a personal choice especially when there are significant long-term financial commitments involved.\n\nI have a wife and a newborn son. While we do have some extra money, we're using it to keep our own little family comfortable and save for a bigger house (currently live in a single bedroom condo). I told Emily that I wouldn't be able to help her foot the bill.\n\nEmily was heartbroken and furious. She argued that family is supposed to support each other and that I'm being selfish and judgmental. Our parents are also upset with me, saying that I'm not being a good brother. They think I should help her because she's family and this is her dream. They're especially upset because it was my idea and I helped her research it. I offered to help Emily by letting her eat dinner with us nightly since she lives nearby and letting her use my car which is cheaper to run since it's electric. She said that's not nearly enough.\n\nI have my own family to think about and financial goals to achieve. I feel it's unreasonable to put myself in a difficult financial position for something that is Emily's personal choice, even if I initially suggested it. So AITA for not supporting her financially?\n\nETA: My sister is a homeowner with a *slightly* bigger house than mine, making *slightly* more money than I do. She can absolutely afford a child. She took from savings to pay for the fourth round of IVF and is rebuilding it as fast as possible by not spending. It isn't like she didn't budget, she just doesn't like being frugal. She also did take me up on the offer to temporarily trade cars and eat dinner with my family nightly. IVF was not my first suggestion. She wouldn't adopt because she wants a biological child. She did not use donor IUI because she wanted PGT done to ensure she'd have a boy because that's what she's wanted since high school. I was not involved in her treatment or consultation and I don't agree with her decision, I helped her research because I was trying to be a good brother. ",

      "body": "We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).\n\nExtended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.\n\nEventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. \n\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.\n\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\n\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my girlfriend out of my place on New Year’s Eve for scaring my little brother?",
      "body": "We can all agree 2020 was a shit year. Particularly for my (29m) family. We lost our dad beginning of the year after he had a heart attack and my little brother (12) had no one to take care of him. Our mom died when he was 3 so our dad was all we had left. \n \nI fought for custody and was appointed his legal guardian.\n\nHonestly it hasn’t been easy. We’re still adjusting to these life changes and my brother is taking it the hardest. For months he was just not himself. Bad attitude, lashing out. I got him in therapy because I knew he was just hurting, plus stress of pandemic.\n\nHis behavior has improved so much since then, even if sometimes there’s days where he’s withdrawn.\n\nDays before Christmas he was feeling sad since it was our first holiday w/o dad. That day, he asked to be left alone. We had a talk to discuss his feelings and I gave him his space after that.\n\nMy girlfriend was over that day and I went out to buy groceries. When I got back my brother was out of his room and helping out. I didn’t think anything of it at the time.\n\nYesterday my brother and I were out having some guy time before going back home to get ready for NYE. \n\nMy brother opened up about how grateful he is for everything and he hopes that I don’t change my mind about taking care of him. I asked why he’d think that and he told me what happened.\n\nThat day when I was out my GF went to his room to tell him he needs to change his attitude and stop moping (her exact words)because he should be grateful I’m taking care of him at all. And that we can still hand him over to the state if we wanted to. \n\nI was furious about this and had to reassure him that was never gonna happen because he really was worried about it. We went home, I confronted my GF and she didn’t deny it. \n\nShe told me it’s true and there was nothing wrong with telling him to stop acting like that when he should be grateful I “gave up my life” to take care of him. \nAnd the thing about giving him up isn’t that big of a deal to her because it’s not like I’ll actually do it.\n\nI said she still scared him with that threat and told her to leave my apartment because honestly, I was far too mad and because I didn’t want her to be near him right now. She started crying, there was more fighting but she left in the end. It was just me and my brother for New Years.\n\nSince last night I’ve been bombarded with calls from all our friends for kicking her out knowing she has no family and nobody else to spend the holiday with. Everyone has sided with her and even my best friend says I may have overreacted by making her leave when she probably thought she was helping. \n\nThey’ve heard my side of the story but still think I was an ass for making her cry and spending the new year alone. I’m having trouble seeing how I could be so here I am looking for internet strangers to weigh in on this.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: OK wow this has gotten a TON of feedback. Thanks everyone for your kind and encouraging words. I might not have replied to a lot of the comments that made me smile but just know that I read an appreciate them! \n\n\nI know I only posted this a few hours ago but I’ve had a day to clear my head and really think about this. I talked to my brother because I wanted to know if she’s said anything else to him. Thankfully she hasn’t and we had another serious chat to remind him everything she told him is completely false. I would never in a million years give him up and that shouldn’t have been put in his head. \n\nAnother thing I told him was that I’m grateful he’s here with me. Without him I wouldn’t have made it through the year and I thanked him for giving me that strength to keep going. Someone who DM’d me suggested reassuring him that he’s not somehow “ruining” my life incase he feels any guilt for what she told him. Thank you for that suggestion!\n\n\nNow, I know you were all waiting on this news. Yes, I did break up with her. Thinking about what a lot of you said, talking to my brother about how this made him feel, and my own thoughts about how badly she acted, I decided that’s not someone I want around me or him. I can’t risk her doing something like this again and ruining any progress he makes in therapy. \n\nI know many of you think I should’ve done it on the spot, but I wanted to make this decision with a clear head and not when my emotions were extremely high. \n\nShe came by my place earlier and we talked outside. Her reaction was as bad as you’d expect and she STILL believed she did nothing wrong, even after I explained it all to her. There was just no making her understand and I told her it was over. I gave her a couple of her things that were lying around my apartment and she left. \n\nMy phone started going off like an hour later so I had to put it on Do Not Disturb. That’s all the drama I could handle for one night. I’ll deal with my friends some other time. \nHonestly, I’m exhausted. Mentally and emotionally drained right now. \n\nI think this weekend we’ll do something  to get our minds off this. I definitely need it after everything and I know my brother does too. It’s been a hard year already without all this extra drama. \nAnyways sorry for the really long update you guys but I didn’t want to leave anyone hanging. \n\nI’m sure more comments will keep coming. I probably won’t be sleeping much tonight so I’ll keep my mind busy by reading and replying to more of you. Thanks again for the support! What a shitty way to start the new year but here’s hoping for better things :)",

      "body": "This happened a few days ago, at the airport during a layover. Basically, I spent about ten minutes listening to my stepdad watch various tiktoks and music videos before I finally asked him to either turn the videos off or use headphones. In response he said some very unkind things about my appearance and stated \"the world does not revolve around you (referring to me)\". It was a very hurtful thing for him to say (previously, we have gotten along pretty well) and I was shocked by the attitude. My mom says I was overreacting bc we were all tired from travelling and that I should have just ignored it, but I don't think I was in the wrong, and other people at the gate kept side-eyeing us while he was watching stuff.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "body": "Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. \n\nI got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by \"pretending they're bad people\" and \"making up false homophobia accusations\". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",

She is a good person but even if she weren't I would. \n\nShe has been trying to be like me lately. And it's driving me nuts. \n\nShe cannot understand the Time Cop rule that two bits of matter cannot occupy the same space. \n\nShe will hold the door for me then stand in the way. When I hold the door for her I stand to the side so she can pass. She cannot seem to get this concept. \n\nI have had to start traveling for work and she drives me to the airport. I could Uber but she says she likes the drive. We always stop for breakfast on the way so it's a way for us to sneak in one more date before I'm gone for a while. \n\nSo I will have my backpack on and my rolling luggage in my hand. She will open the door go through and hold the storm door. But she will fully stand in the way.  \n\nI have explained the concept of standing to the side. I've asked her to please just go through and I will deal. I've tried leaving before her so I can deal. I've even tried just standing inches away as she holds the door and I cannot move forward. Nothing works. \n\nI was in a hurry yesterday because my flight was changed. We could still stop for breakfast but we didn't have much leeway. \n\nAnd she would not get out of the way. I lost my coolmand asked her to please get the hell out of the way because I needed to get to the car. \n\nShe is mad at me and has brought up my rudeness at both our calls since she dropped me off. \n\nI think that I have been very patient and she should have taken the hint before now.

      "body": "I (24F) live in an apartment building and have a neighbor, Kyah (27F), who’s friendly but a bit careless. Over the past six months, Kyah’s borrowed several things from me tools, a ladder, even my Wi-Fi password when her internet was down. I didn’t mind at first, but she’s terrible about returning stuff. My screwdriver set is still missing, she kept my ladder for weeks until I asked for it back, and she used my Wi-Fi for a month without offering to chip in for the bill. Each time, I’ve been polite and let it slide, thinking she’d get better about it. Last weekend, I ran into Kyah at the grocery store. She was at the checkout with a cart full of stuff but realized she’d forgotten her wallet. She asked if I could cover her $85 bill, promising to pay me back that evening. I hesitated because of her track record with my stuff and because I’m on a tight budget myself. I told her I could spot her $20 for essentials but couldn’t cover the whole bill, especially since it included things like expensive snacks and beer. She got frustrated, saying I was unneighborly and that she’d have done the same for me. She ended up leaving most of her items behind and only buying what she could with the cash she found in her pocket. Since then, Kyah’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and another neighbor said Kyah called me stingy. I feel bad because I know forgetting a wallet is stressful, and maybe I could’ve helped more since we’re neighbors. But I also feel like her pattern of borrowing without reciprocating made me wary. \n\nAITA for not covering her full grocery bill?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to help my brother after his wife blabbed about my financial situation?",
      "body": "A few years ago I won a lottery and became set for many lives over. Even though my name and winnings were public records, I worked hard to keep it a secret. For the most part it worked. After verifying my winnings and setting up a trust, I told my family. \n\nMy plan was to basically help each of my three brothers and my parents depending on their needs. My brother Chris and his wife Alice had three kids and I offered to pay for a down payment on a house they wanted. As crazy as it sounds, I was more broke the first year of winning than the year before I won because I was helping my family out.\n\nI had one rule for anyone who took money from me - don't tell anyone about my money. Well Chris and Alice did for clout and that unleashed a lot of people bombarding me with money requests. These were friends of theirs, friends of friends of theirs, in-laws, etc. Like my brother's BIL asked me to pay for a wedding in St Lucia because his fiancée wanted one and I met the guy twice in nine years. Though this happened in 2021, people still bother me constantly for money.\n\nI was pissed and cut my brother off. This led to a rift in the family and I largely became estranged from them. It was unfortunate because I was very close to my nephews and wanted to spoil them. \n\nLast week my other brother emailed me and said Chris has been sick all year and is bed ridden and gets specialized care. Something to do with breathing. I said that was sad. He said that Chris and Alice were going to lose the house because Chris hasn't been working. They have four kids from age 4 to 15. I told him if he had something to say, then say it. He asked me if I'd help them out by paying their outstanding bills and until they can get back on their feet. \n\nI said no. The money isn't the issue. It's my privacy. I have no idea if they will keep their mouths shut about my helping them. I get painted as a \"nice rich guy\" and then I have 10 people bothering me with their problems. You help them once, they'll keep on coming back. It's very funny how people just happen to have financial emergencies when you're helping others out. \n\nThe other problem is that of my brother does pass, then I don't want Alice getting a house that I paid 20% of. She and I don't get along and she's the one who put my business out there. She was so certain that I'd take care of them that she didn't even bother to say \"thanks for the down payment on our dream house!\" \n\nHow bad is their financial situation? Bad. I'd offer to help in other ways but beggars want to be choosers and negotiate their charity.\n\nEdit: I am not setting up some sort of loan settlement with my brother and his wife. They don't have the means to pay me back and would see it as a sign of weakness. Ironically the only other person who is against giving them money is my financial advisor.\n\nSorry, I gave them $420,000 to buy a house and they managed to fuck that up. They live in a nicer house than I do. I don't live fancy. I don't own a Rolex and my clothes have holes in them. I bought my furniture from Big Lots.\n\nMy other reason for not helping is that I know for a fact that his wife wouldn't help me if the roles were reversed and would be less nice about it. I love my nephews but I'm won't be blackmailed over them. When they come of age and reach out to me then I'll be there for them. ",

      "title": "AITA for banning my mum’s boyfriend from my life after what he did at my grandad’s funeral?",
      "body": "My mum (56) has been dating a man (“Adam”) for 5 years. I’m 28F. They met online during COVID and said “I love you” within 3 weeks—before they’d even met in person. At the time, we had just gotten out of a 20+ year abusive home situation (our mum didn’t protect us—we got us all out), We’d encouraged her to date to stop her going back to dad, but the intensity of the relationship raised red flags.\n\nAdam is in his late 50s, never married, supposedly has a good job but nothing to show for it. I suspect he gambles, he watches every sport, every team, obsessively. He lives in England; we’re in Ireland.\n\nThere have always been red flags—subtle digs about my mum aging, calling her decisions “our” decisions but keeping his private. He makes no effort with family and isolates her. I think he’s using her and possibly planning to freeload off her divorce settlement.\n\nThe final straw was him watching football on his phone for 15+ minutes at my grandad’s funeral. I waited a few weeks to tell my mum. When I did, he denied it—she believed him over me.\n\nThings got tense. My sister 22F and I ended up in family therapy (without him) and agreed to one last conversation with Adam. We told our mum: if it went badly, she could keep seeing him, but she had to stop trying to involve us. It was a big deal—we were anxious and triggered by having to confront a man about his behaviour, given our past.\n\nThe conversation was awful. He said, “We’ll agree to disagree,” then admitted he “glanced” at his phone, then finally admitted to watching the match. Still—no apology.\n\nSince then (6 months ago), we’ve had no contact with him. I’ve told him I don’t want to speak to him again. Now my mum is saying we need to “fix things” and come for dinner to “sort it out.” She gets upset when we say no.\n\nI’m exhausted. I can’t control who she dates—but I won’t be around him. It’s stressful, triggering, and upsetting. Some people say we’re being “overly sensitive” due to cPTSD. But honestly, we’re too tolerant—we survived years of abuse. If we were fragile, we would’ve broken. We didn’t.\n\nNow I’m getting married next year. And I’m already heartbroken because my dad won’t walk me down the aisle—not because he’s gone, but because of what he did to us. That’s something I’ve had to grieve. But now it feels like another man in my mum’s life is going to ruin another major moment. My graduation, birthdays—those were all made miserable by my dad. And now it feels like my wedding could be overshadowed by another man she’s putting first. I just don’t understand how it’s unreasonable to want my wedding day to be about me—for once—not about managing someone else’s boyfriend.\n\nMy mum clearly thinks I’m the problem—that I’m being difficult and dramatic because of our past. And honestly, I’m starting to feel like I am the asshole. But deep down, I don’t think I am. I just feel like one for standing my ground.\n\nAITA for drawing this boundary and saying I don’t want to spend Christmas or my wedding with this man?\n\nEdit: my mum will definitely come to my wedding, we are actually really close and get on so well (apart from this drama) which is why it’s even more hurtful. When it’s not about men we have a really good relationship. It does feel more like a sister relationship - she’s honestly not a bad person, she is a great mum in lots of ways, she just makes really bad decisions with men that make it look that way. \n\nMy little sister has supported me and been there for me through everything - she’s who will walk me down the aisle we’ve been through everything together it’s only right ❤️ \n\nFurther edit: \nI have said to her about going No contact if she continues to force him on us and she feels this is me forcing her to break up with him and not letting her make her own decisions. \n\nEdit 3: since around march 2024 I refuse to be anywhere near him, I don’t go to her house when he’s over, I don’t even pick up the phone if she rings  when they are together (as she’d tried to force me to speak to him on my birthday before). \nAt Christmas I’d said either I go to the family Christmas dinner or he does, there was a lot of tears and tantrums from her but I held my ground. It’s harder for my sister because she lives with my mum - but she refuses to enter a room if he’s in it, if he follows her into a room she leaves, and she trusts to stay away from the house as much as possible. \nIf mum talks about Adam I just pretend she didn’t say anything and continue on with the conversation as if that sentence hadn’t happened. Or walking away. This is what mum thinks is harsh, he somehow appears in every conversation even when it’s pointless to include him.",

She now lives with his parents bc she cheated on her husband, the new bf now lives there too. \n\nWe moved to an apartment but still get our items shipped to our parents since our place is sketchy. \n\nI had bought Coachella tickets and it was sent to his house. Well, 2 weeks before Coachella the person I was going to Coachella with got COVID and so we decided to sell our tickets. \n\nOnly problem is, my ticket never came. we kept asking everyone who lived at the house for weeks if they had seen the package to which they said no. We searched the living room and kitchen but nothing came up. \n\nA month prior to this his aunt had told his mom that she was selling Coachella tickets that her bf had gotten from his niece. It never crossed my mind that this ticket was mine. \n\n\nI was starting to get stressed bc the ticket was $600 and I was about to have to drive to the venue to pick up my ticket and go to the concert alone.\n\nThe DAY before Coachella my bfs aunt confesses to her crime. Her bf had stolen my ticket and had been trying to sell it off. His aunt tried to say she had no idea it was my ticket bc the package had no name, this is a lie. \n\nonce I hear about it I immediately start shaking and sobbing feeling betrayed and that we stressed out over nothing. \n\nSince they probably already sold the ticket I couldn’t even go to Coachella. My bf called his mom to tell her how fucked up this is and his parents agree. \n\nShe never apologizes just kept up her lies and excuses. I was so fed up that I said “you know it’s illegal to steal other ppls mail, I could go to the police about this”. This upset his aunt and I felt bad about this.\n\nMy bf said the right thing to do is for my aunt to send us the $600.\n\nWe haven’t talked about this incident since with them but I know they talk shit about me to their whole family bc that’s what they do. When I go to his family parties I just stay quiet and act friendly.\n\nI’m an extremely sensitive person and the thing that hurt the most about this situation is that someone close to me could lie and betray me like that after seeing how stressed me and her nephew was. \n\nI feel like the asshole bc I’ve created a rift between him and his ex-favorite aunt. I still feel guilty. Did I overreact? Did I mess up his relationship with his family? ",

      "body": "I (23M) was on a call with my girlfriend (22F). She was talking about how she feels guilty that her parents have been providing for her financially. I get where she’s coming from, we both come from poor families, but they're amazing in their own ways. I love how her parents and siblings are all supportive of her education, especially her sisters. Both of her parents are retired, and her older sister is the one supporting her financially. It’s not an easy thing to sacrifice your early adult life for your sibling’s future, and I truly respect that. I’ve also supported her financially ever since I migrated to the US. She always says no, but there have been times when money was urgently needed.\n\nAnyway, she said she feels guilty and can’t even feel happy about her graduation because she thinks it’s the only bare minimum she finised. She also has more on her mind, like review centers and passing the board exam. I listened, comforted her, and tried to console her by saying, “It’s okay.” then she  suddenly snapped at me and said, “It’s not appropriate to just say ‘it’s okay’ when it’s not.” I meant that it’s okay to feel the way she does and all. \n\nAnother time, she told me she was feeling pressured about the board exams. I said something like, “Think of the past problems you’ve had. At the time, they seemed big and heavy, but looking back, they’ve become nonexistent, something that you can pat yourself at the back when looking back and this problem might feel the same way in the future.” She told me that it wasn’t helpful. I tried explaining what I meant, but she told me to stop because it added pressure. Then she explained how we have different coping mechanisms, and what works for me doesn’t necessarily work for her. I completely agree with that, and I apologized.\n\nBut we’ve had many arguments about things that I “should’ve said,” as if there’s a pre-written script I’m supposed to hit and if I don’t say exactly what she wants to hear, it turns into a problem.\nWhat upsets me the most was when she said, “Stop worrying about my problems because they’re not yours anyway.” That really hurt, after five years together, you're telling me not to worry about something that clearly affects you which I care deeply about? I felt so offended and left out. I’ve always tried to be there for her, to comfort and support her, to make sure she feels seen and heard. But every time I try, it feels like she just rejects it. I was so done, and I dropped the call.\n\nAre my feelings valid or am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not telling a woman she was about to sit in poop?",
      "body": "I (26M) was at a crowded park recently where there were food trucks set up and people sitting around eating. Seating was pretty limited, and most people were sitting on this low concrete wall that runs along the edge of a parking lot. On the other side of the wall is a grassy area that's level with the top of the wall, so people sit with their backs toward the grass and legs facing the lot.\n\nI had just gotten my food when I noticed the only free spot left. At the same time, I saw a girl, well dressed for the park also walking toward it. She saw it first and was headed that way, but I was closer and got there before her despite her running when she saw me approaching it.\n\nAs I got to it, I looked down at the grass behind the wall and saw a big pile of dog poop right where someone’s lower back or clothes would land if they leaned or sat back. It was pretty gross, and I decided not to sit.\n\nRight then, she walked up and looked annoyed, saying, “Seriously? I was going to sit there.” I didn’t want to make a thing of it, so I just stepped aside and said, “Go ahead, you can have it.”\n\nShe immediately sat down without checking behind her and just a second later jumped up with a disgusted look on her face. The poop was stuck to the back of her skirt. She turned to me and snapped, “Why didn’t you say anything?”\n\nI told her, “I saw it, yeah, but I didn’t know how you were planning to sit. For all I knew you were just going to perch on the edge or sit upright. It’s a park — people walk their dogs here. You’ve got to check before sitting down.”\n\nShe kept insisting I should’ve warned her, but I told her I wasn’t trying to be petty, I genuinely didn’t know how far back she was going to lean or sit, and it wasn’t really my responsibility to check the ground for her. She could have sat only on the wall and not on the grass and would have been fine.\n\nShe eventually walked off frustrated, but now I’m wondering if I should’ve just said something anyway. But I feel like especially since she was so confrontational about the spot it wasn't really necessary.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "I didn't know how to title the post. I apologise. \n\nMy son is eleven months old and 97th percentile for height. He is a big ass baby (currently 36in tall - or about the size of your average 2.5yo) and in 3T clothing. \n\nHowever, despite him being so big, he is still just a baby and most of his nutrition ia still from breastmilk. \n\nFor the 4th we had a big family cookout and my brother invited his girlfriend. I live out of state and I didn't want my flights to be too close together so I'm staying for a bit longer. My brother and his girlfriend are doing the same thing.\n\nMy family is aware that my son is a baby, obviously, but my brothers girlfriend was not and was initially very shocked when she saw him \"misbehaving\". We explained that he's still a baby, so he's still just exploring the world.\n\nShe remained uncomfortable but we mostly avoid each other. Because he's so big feeding him is a chore so I use an armchair as there isn't enough support elsewhere and so there isn't much I can do about covering up (he gets sweaty under blankets and won't eat).\n\nIt's been a tense couple of weeks. Last night I think we both kind of lost it. My son needed feeding and she was in the chair; I asked her to move which she whined about but did get up. Everything was fine for another hour or so until she demanded my brother pay for her to go to a hotel for the remaining nights because she can't cope with me and the baby.\n\nHe asked what she meant and she said that he's clearly big enough to be on real food and I enjoy making her uncomfortable by feeding him in front of her. \n\nI got embarrassingly upset and told her that she should keep her mouth shut because she clearly doesn't know the first thing about parenting and certainly doesn't know anything about me or my son.\n\nWe argued the same points for a little more until my son woke from his nap and I left to collect him. She then left after telling us all, loudly, that she needs to \"protect her peace\" (which is honestly not a phrase I thought real people said). \n\nMy brother told me I was being immature and left with her. My dad is on \"my side\" but did tell me I should have removed myself from the situation as I'm a grown woman and she's still a teenager (I'm three years older than her so I think thats BS). My mom is neutral but is still trying to convince my brother to come home and ended up paying for their hotel. She thinks I could have been a lot more understanding. \n\nAITA? Was I completely out of order?",

      "title": "AITA for calling my boyfriend an insecure little boy after his repeated jokes that I \"cheated the system\" to get to a career that pays more than his?",
      "body": "Tim and I met in an English literature class our junior year of college, and we’ve been together the ten years since. While he ended up going into IT, I stayed in the liberal arts track and ended up doing non-profit work after college when I realized I didn’t actually want to be a schoolteacher. Just to say that we always assumed he’d out-earn me by a considerable margin, though when he made more I always insisted we split things evenly to avoid potential resentment down the road.\n\nI’ve had sort of a non-linear career path, but ended up switching to the corporate world. To make a long story short, my liberal arts degree and time doing non-profit work gave me a lot of skills that enable me to really excel professionally in some more niche areas. I recently started a new job as a consultant, making way more than I’d ever anticipated. When I got the offer, I told Tim that the pay was “amazing”, but he didn’t ask about the actual amount and I didn’t want to be braggy about it, especially since I was fairly sure it was above his current income.\n\nWell we just put in an application for a new place, and in the process of having to submit our paystubs it’s become obvious that I make roughly 30% more than he does now. I expected him to think that was cool, since he’s a feminist and has always been super supportive of my career. But instead he’s started to make increasingly harsh jabs about how I “cheated the system” to get where I am, that no English lit major makes more than a cyber security professional without cheating somehow.\n\nHis major point is that I got my first job out of nepotism, which set me up to “trample” more qualified people who didn’t have the same advantages. It’s true that I got my first post-college job after being referred by a sorority sister, but it was for non-profit work making 22k/yr, not exactly at somebody’s daddy’s firm. He also points out that at my first corporate job, I snagged a big promotion after volunteering to take on starting up the company’s diversity/equity/inclusion program, and I’ll admit that were I a white *man*, it’s highly unlikely I would have been able to be the face of the eventually high-profile diversity program. Tim also notes that I was awarded a small college scholarship for being a “promising female writer”, when no such scholarship existed for males.\n\nBut all that said…I still don’t feel like I cheated the system, and it makes me angry to listen to him “joke” about it, especially since I grew up blue collar and worked fulltime while going to school fulltime to afford my degree. I reached a breaking point yesterday when he made a crack about how the new/first woman on his team is an obvious diversity hire. I told him that his jokes about women cheating the system to get ahead aren’t funny or “guy-talk ribbing” as he says, they make him sound like an insecure little boy. He told me I was being a naïve Karen and we haven’t really talked since yesterday. Did I go too far?",

      "body": "At the beginning of this year, I found out BIL got married and he was moving near us. I told him rent is pretty expensive so I wouldn’t recommend it. However he said it’s all good because his wife will help pay for rent until his finds a job. Fast forward a month, my wife tells me he’s about to sign a 2.5k a month lease for 12 months for a 3 bedroom apartment. I told her financially, it was a bad idea considering he doesn’t have a job and they could find something cheaper and wtf you need 3bed rooms for?. BIL once again says he’s good and his wife agreed to pay rent when they both signed the lease. \n\n\n\nJust yesterday my wife’s tells me he needs help paying rent for this month. Turns out he only had money for the first two months for rent. So he asked his wife to help and she apparently refused. So I said ok well then they both will get evicted. It was causal talk until my wife dropped the hammer….turns out apparently BIL wife is blackmailing him to pay all the rent regardless if he has a job or not. Wife and I don’t know what the black mail is and BIL won’t tell us. Then my wife asked if I could help him pay rent. I said: \n\n“After my repeated advise was ignored, if your brother was hanging on a cliff and I was on the edge of the cliff and I had a pocket full of fucks and he only need one to be saved, I WOULD NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK” \n\nAfter reflecting later, I realized that comment was a bit harsh but idk. I was just furious at the situation, I was raised to be very mindful of my financials and this is not the first time he’s asked for money. Whenever we go out, I’m always paying. I do not expect it back, but there’s no way I can lend him 2.5k for poor decisions he’s made. \n\nI’m afraid my refusal will put my marriage in jeopardy because of BIL\n\nWhat do I do ? \n\n\n",

I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.\n\nThis woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.\n\nSo, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, \"Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?\" To which I replied, \"Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high.\" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. \n\nI came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure.

      "body": "My fiancée Allie(31f) is the type of person that calls people 2 or 3 times in a row when she wants to get ahold of them for anything. The first time she did this to my parents we were driving to a concert and I asked her to call my folks from my phone. She called, they didn't pick up. She started calling my mom again right away and I asked what she was doing. My mom picked up right away worried.  Allie asked our question, I told mom false alarm, hung up. She asked why my mom had been irritated and I explained to her in my family, we only call twice in a row if it's an emergency. \n\nAllie has never followed this and will always call them repeatedly for the most mundane stuff. If one doesn't answer she'll sometimes call my other parent. \n\nAll that to say a couple of weeks ago she broke her leg while working around the house. I was in a workshop for work that day and could only check my phone on breaks. She called my parents since they live a couple streets over but neither answered their phones. She wound up having to call an ambulance. I got her message about 2 hours after she fell and went to the hospital. She was pretty mad at my parents when I got there. I let then know what happened and they also rushed to the hospital to apologize and check on her. She didn't want them coming in so they sat outside for a bit, got her flowers from the gift shop and eventually went home.\n\nI took some time off work to take care of her and my parents have been offering help as they could. Her sister drove in to help so I could go back to work. Last night I decided to make a nicer dinner than usual and wanted to invite my parents. I gave her a heads up I was inviting them and asked if she wanted me to rearrange some of the chairs and table so we can all eat together. \n\nShe got mad I wanted to invite them and is of the mind I shouldn't be wanting to see/speak with them after they ignored her. Her sister agrees with her and feels I'm putting my parents over my soon to be wife. Up until this point I haven't said anything to her about the situation but I did then and told her it was a massive fuck-up in communication on everyone's part and time we all talk it out to put behind us. Neither she nor her sister think she should stop being mad at them. Was I an asshole to invite my parents over?\n\nAsked info: My parents were sitting outside for their quiet time when she called. It's not unusual for them to not answer calls/texts and wait to return them later when they do that. I myself had to do the two calls routine so they knew it was urgent.",

We drove around, watched a movie, and decided to end it with a stop by a local diner. \n\nWe had a really nice time, and after we paid and got back in the car, I buckled up and noticed she was having trouble. She couldn't get the seatbelt to click into the seat, and I even tried to help her. It was close, but she started insisting that we just drive off. She was heavily embarassed but I was insisting that I was not going to leave until she buckled. It was not safe and I didn't feel comfortable.\n\nI ended up trying a bit more and was able to click in the seatbelt. I felt really bad about making her go through that embarrassment, but I wanted to make sure that we were both safe. \n\nThe drive back to her place was quiet and a little uncomfortable. I tried to assure her that it was okay and that she didn't have to be embarrassed, trying to make her feel better but she was brushing it off. \n\nWe ended the night awkward and I felt really bad.\n\nTLDR; My friend couldn't buckle her seatbelt because of her weight but I wouldn't leave until she did. It made her embarrassed and I felt really bad.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Hey guys, I appreciate the comments. I think getting a seatbelt extender to keep in my glovebox sounds like a great idea. And as for my friend, she is working on losing weight and has been for a while. This situation occurred many months ago but has been on my mind since. I don't appreciate any comments that dehumanize her based on her weight. Just because she's fat, doesn't make it okay. And you shouldn't assume things you don't know (i.e. that she isn't doing something about her weight).",

Things have been going well and one of the great things is that Felix is a builder and so everything with the nursery went pretty smoothly pretty fast! We agreed at the start what kind of vibe we wanted to go with it and it's pretty much already done. Figured that we'd get it sorted as soon as possible so it wasn't another thing to worry about later.\n\nMy MIL has always been a bit of a nightmare but has been better since the news that I'm pregnant (though not without issue - for example, she told me that I should \"lose some weight\" and that it wasn't \"heathy\" for me or the baby. She knows that I used to struggle with anorexia and I'm not any sort of unhealthy weight). In the past I've kept my mouth shut and let Felix deal with her. As the nursery has almost been completed, she's suddenly decided to invite herself around more - I work from home currently, she comes in on the regular, asks me when I'm going to have lunch and \"oh could you just pop me something in too!\" and then will wander into the nursery and start rearranging things.\n\nI know this sounds stupid but once she literally bought an IKEA bag full of stuff that she put in there. It doesn't match. But I've never said anything really beyond, \"Oh, thanks so much for the thought\" etc. Yesterday when she came around uninvited, she looked me up and down and said \"Really? Joggers? Thank god Felix isn't here\" and then walked into the nursery and started asking me where the pillow she'd put in the crib had gone, why I'd taken out the fairylights hanging on the wall right by it, etc. I explained that they were potential safety hazards to the future baby and that I'd taken them out.\n\nShe started with, \"Oh, well, *I've* had three children\" and \"I really think you should take more of my advice\" and then looked me in the eyes and said \"You're really not going to be a good mother at this rate\". I don't know if it was the pregnancy hormones but I just stared at her for a moment and then told her to get out of the house. I'd been up all night and had loads of work and wasn't in the mood. She got very uptight about it and then left.\n\nFelix says he's going to talk to her and tell her that she shouldn't be reorganising anything without our permission, but I don't know if it was just the hormones and I'm being unreasonable.

All new foods were tried under medical supervision.\n\nWhile she can eat meat she can’t eat any fun meat like nuggets because of egg contact. One of the kids she recently met with is our new Neighbour who is around four houses away. They are completely vegan and their son doesn’t eat anything they don’t. So at his birthday she could eat the actual  cake and not a muffin I’d sent. It cheered her up and they had play dates even when we weren’t supposed to. I was glad she made a friend.\n\nHis parents  hadn’t called for a while and didn’t pick up ours. When I saw his dad while I was out I was like ‘hey what’s wrong‘ and he was really hostile, telling me to never talk to him or his wife again and that he’d pray for my daughter. I thought that was crossing the line. He pulled his phone out and showed me a very rude text from my husband. I didn’t believe his story that my husband started a fight, but when I asked him about it he was proud that Shelia wasn’t hanging out with hippies. I remembered the vegan hate and I was like until he apologized to that family and they agreed to let their kid play with ours I’d never cook meat again. He said I needed to get over it and do my Job but I am cooking, just not what he would like. AITA\n\nEdit: I will try to find couple’s counseling although I don’t think he’ll agree to it. I hope Ina forgives me (vegan mom, since this blew up, I’m really very sorry and I won’t bother you again.) thank you all for your responses.",

      "body": "My wife and I (both late 20s) had our first child together in June. Before he was born there was a lot of talk about names from different family members on both sides, but the pressure to tell was on my side specifically. We didn't tell a soul what the name would be until our son was born and we had left the hospital. My parents were disappointed when we announced our sons name.\n\nMy family are very traditional in how they named us. We were each named after grandparents and that's how they feel everyone should name their kids. My wife's family don't have a tradition when it comes to naming babies. They just name them and go. No fuss or insisting on certain names. But my wife's side tends to favor more uncommon and unusual names. \n\nMy wife's and my taste tends to lean a lot more to her side than to mine. Which is how we ended up choosing the name Hollis for our son. This was not something my parents liked because they expected our son to be either Jack (my dad) or Parker (my FIL). But I know they were expecting a little Jack to be born. So that added to their reaction. But they quizzed us on our choice to \"break tradition\" and I told them it wasn't a tradition my wife's family used and we decided we weren't going to have one either.\n\nOver the last couple of months both parents have questioned why, have wanted to discuss other names for future babies. My mom has been the worst by far. She asked why we went with something so unlike the names we have in our family. I told her our family wasn't the only family involved, but that we also didn't take the family tastes into account. We went with what we liked. She pointed out our taste were a lot like my ILs and I said yes, but that it wasn't about my ILs and their taste, it was about my wife's and my taste. I told her I was done discussing it and since that point I now change the topic or end the conversation when she brings it up or refuses to let it go.\n\nWe had a little naming ceremony on Saturday and my mom decided she was going to dig in her heels about the name and she told me we'd picked a stupid name and she hated it, she wanted us to change it and name him Jack or Parker. She told me we had no business breaking a long held tradition in our family and there's a reason those traditions are there so foolish people can't name their babies the worst names imaginable. She also said my ILs must be so smug thinking they'll have at least two stupidly named grandkids like they had all stupidly named kids. I lost my temper. I told her to shut up and accept that we're not naming our kids like she and dad named me and my siblings and I told her she would need to leave and learn to be more respectful because I would not take those insults against my wife or her family lying down. My mom hated being told to shut up and she said I had no excuse for rudeness to her face. I thought she was crazy when she was rude.\n\nAITA though?",

      "body": "I (28M) have been married to my wife (31F) for about a year. Overall, things are great, but one thing that’s been bugging me is that my wife doesn’t know how to cook—at all. I’ve always been the one to handle meals, which I was fine with in the beginning because I enjoy cooking. But over time, it’s started to wear on me, especially when I come home after a long day at work and still have to cook dinner while she relaxes. She refuses to cook and claims there is nothing wrong with not being able to cook. It’s been an ongoing issue between us. I have been trying to teach her but she is really bad at it. Many conversation about this \n\nThe other night, my mom (56F) came over for dinner. As usual, I was in the kitchen preparing everything, and my wife was sitting with my mom. At one point, my mom offered to help, and I asked if she could make the gravy or cut some fruit .  My wife was standing around in the kitchen when my mom handed her a knife and asked her to cut some fruit while she handled the gravy. My wife couldn’t figure out how to hold it properly and ended up making a mess. My mom watched her fail to cut the fruit and then blurted out, “It’s honestly kind of pathetic that you don’t even know how to cut a piece of fruit at your age.” She then went behind her and started to guide her how to cut stuff like you do with a kid. My wife kinda shrugged and finished cutting her fruit with my mom guiding her  Dinner happens and I noticed my wife was not happy the whole night.\n\nMy mom left and she was pissed I didn’t defend her. That I embarrassed her by letting it happens We got into a bad argument and I told her that it is pathetic she can not even cut fruit. She is literally older than me and can’t hold a knife properly.\nShe told me that is not the point and I needed to defend her and it’s not her fault she is bad at cooking. I point out it is, and she is embarrassed because not being able to hold a knife properly is embarrassing for an adult \n\n\nMy wife thinks I am a huge jerk\n\nEdit: I can not keep up, over 2000 comments and I have things to do. If you have an info may already be answer in a previous comment \n\n\nSo update: I definitely think this is weaponized incompetence, I will suggest marriage counseling and cooking classes. If things don't change I will be out. I will make this very clear\n\nAlso for those asking, it was strawberries. She was smushing them and cutting them with the stems still on",

Nature hikes are fine. I don't *mind* them, but I do dislike walking up large hills. Walking downhill is the easiest thing ever, it's like being nature's passenger princess. You just put your foot forward and let gravity do all the work. Walking uphill conversely is very draining and leaves me sweaty.\n\nI don't make a point to complain about something when I do it, so when I was walking uphill, despite not liking it much, I held basic conversation with my brother. \n\nAs we were heading back down, he asked me if I was having fun and I said no. Not because of any fault of my brother, I just didn't find the activity fun. Not even bad, just satisfactory. Later when he was driving me to the airport for my flight home he told me \"If I ask you if you're having fun, don't say 'no.'\"\n\nI understand that it can be demoralizing to hear someone's not having fun, but I don't like it when people ask for my opinion and get upset when I give my honest answer.

      "body": "My husband (38M) and I (37F) have been married for 9 years and have 2 kids (8 & 6). He works a hybrid schedule so he's home 2-3 days a week. I'm a nurse at an understaffed hospital. Due to that staffing shortage, I was offered to temporarily switch my work hours to the overnight shift. It came with a nice bump in pay which could really help us out financially. My husband was very much against it because of the changes it would make to our day-to-day lives. I initially declined the offer but they countered with an even higher pay bump, so I took it.\n\nIt's been 5 months since I changed hours and my husband hates it. My hours are now 10pm-8am M-Thu and midnight-9am Sunday morning. I usually make it home just in time to see the kids off to school, run some errands or get things done at home in the morning, then sleep until the kids' bedtime and head to work. I like to think I've gotten pretty efficient at it since the change, but my husband disagrees.\n\nI won't lie, he has had to pick up a lot of kid-related things that we used to share. Pretty much any rides they need are done by him. Any weekday activities he takes care of. Now that the kids are done with school we have them in a summer daycare program and he does all the drop-offs and pick-ups.\n\nHe's been complaining to me ever since the kids' school year ended that this isn't working for him anymore. He keeps asking when I can switch my hours back. I told him that the original plan was 6-8 months so it could be soon, but it's only been 5 months.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't know if I want to switch back. I'm making and saving a lot more money. Once I adjusted to the sleep schedule, I feel like I actually have more energy and can get more stuff done when I get home from work.\n\nThis past weekend, my husband practically begged me to ask my supervisor when I can switch my hours back. I finally told him that I'm not sure if I want to do that. He flipped out on me. He told me this isn't what he signed up for when we got married. He told me he feels lied to because not only did I accept the offer without his \"final approval\" but now I'm going back on my word that it would be temporary.\n\nHe said that if I'm going to keep my current night shift, then I need to do more things at home since I have the whole place to myself during the day. I asked him what more he thinks I should do and he actually made a list. He put pretty much all the yard work on there, which is usually stuff he takes care of and that I don't know how to do. I told him I don't know how to do all of that stuff and he told me \"If I can learn how to fold a fitted sheet, you can learn how to mow the lawn.\"\n\nI told him that doesn't seem like a fair division of labor and he told me that he's taken on all the kid stuff so I need to do more of everything else. I told him that doing manual labor after I worked all night isn't going to work for me and he told me to change my hours back then.",

The next morning, I open the fridge, and it’s gone. I texted my roommate, and he said, “Oh, my girlfriend was hungry, so she ate it. Sorry, man.”\n\nThat was the last straw. I told him we needed to talk and said that while I’m okay with her visiting sometimes, she can’t keep staying over every weekend and eating my food.

He got defensive, saying that since he pays rent, she should be able to stay over whenever, and I’m making a big deal out of “just a few snacks.”\n\nI stood my ground and told him she needs to stop coming over so often unless they start buying their own food and being more considerate. Now, he’s pissed at me, and I’m getting the cold shoulder.\n\nAITA for putting my foot down after his girlfriend kept eating all my food?",

Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn’t do anything. I recently got off a call with my mom saying I should have told Maddie that was wrong to say. I told her what do you expect she thinks y’all hate her and y’all do nothing to dispel those thoughts. She just got quiet for a bit then said I still shouldn’t let her say something like that to family and hung up. \n\nMy husband is on my side but he also isn’t a fan of my family so I need an outside opinion AITA? \n\nEdit: to make some of you feel better we don’t bring her around them often she only sees them on holidays with the rest of our extended family.  We were only visiting today to get something I was left in a will. As for babysitting I have only asked twice in extreme emergencies and they said no. I have talked to them about this but they say it’s not favoritism she just needs less help because we are better off. \n\nUpdate: just got off the phone with my uncle. Apparently dad called him ranting about how disrespectful we are.  Apparently this all stems from me going to college. Dad said since I had to be all hoity toity and go to college I shouldn’t need his help and I should be living the easy life. He also said I’m selfish for trying to take help away from those who need it. Not sure what to think about all that he’s never brought up having a problem with that before. I’m going to discuss this with the rest of the family because with the holidays approaching I don’t want to cut everybody else out to avoid them so I’m going to ask how they feel about all this.",

      "title": "AITA for buying a vacuum cleaner for our apartment after my roommate said she was bringing one?",
      "body": "I just moved into a new apartment in Boston with two other roommates. We’re all PhD students in our mid-to-late 20s (25F, 24F, 27F), and we didn’t know each other before moving in. Before signing the lease, we talked about living habits and expectations. Everyone said they were clean. Not just average clean, but \"upper quartile\" clean. I clarified that to me, clean means wiping down surfaces after use, vacuuming and dusting regularly, and keeping things in their designated places.\n\nWe also discussed splitting up the responsibility for smaller shared appliances. One roommate said she had a vacuum. We agreed that would be her contribution, so I didn’t bring one. When we moved in, it turned out that the “vacuum” was actually a Roomba.\n\nI don’t have a problem with Roombas. They’re fine for light maintenance if run frequently. But I don’t think it’s fair to treat it as the only vacuum for the entire apartment. It doesn’t have a hose, can’t clean corners or high surfaces, and doesn’t work for any kind of mess. She also only wants to run it every other week, which doesn’t really keep up with the dust and dirt of three people. The Roomba also hasn’t mapped the apartment well due to its infrequent use. Most of the time, it just bonks around like a lost toddler at IKEA until someone takes pity on it and turns it around.\n\nI brought this up and said I didn’t think the Roomba was sufficient on its own. She disagreed and said plenty of people only use a Roomba. I didn’t want to argue further, but I have indoor allergies, and I don’t feel comfortable with that level of cleaning. So, I bought my own vacuum (a nice bagged one with an allergy filter) to use in my room and in the common space when I’m the one doing the cleaning.\n\nWhen I brought it home, she was annoyed and said I had gone behind her back and broken our agreement. I didn’t see it that way, and shared that I’m not asking anyone else to use it or share costs. I just wanted to be able to clean the apartment to a level that works for me. \n\nOur other roommate said she doesn’t really have a preference and doesn’t care, so it seems like she is currently steering clear of this. There's no blame or fault to be found in her at all; I totally understand why she might want to stay neutral. \n\nI don’t want to be the problem roommate, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped. AITA?",

      "body": "I (23M) have a coworker (25M) who is a mooch. If you get something for lunch, he wants you to get him something too, but expects you to buy it for him because since you mentioned it, he says you offered. At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he’s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don’t like him.\n\nSo yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I’d bring him something but I wasn’t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.\n\nWhen I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he’s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he’s pissed that I “narc’d” and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn’t worth getting him in trouble over.\n\nToday no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he’s whining that we’re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior. He said I’m an asshole, but I don’t really feel bad that a mooch who thinks it’s funny to scam his coworkers thinks I’m an asshole. My little brother is on here a lot and suggested I post though, so AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for throwing my sister and her son out of my house?",
      "body": "I (35M) am a single father of 3 boys (10M, 7M and 3M). Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. \nA few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. \nYesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. \nBefore we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said \"besides, he's right, kids need a mom\". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said \"see, it's even turning you into a pu**y\". \nMy in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said \"listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person\". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. \nShe is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. \nAita for throwing her out?\n\nUPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. \nI want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. \nMy nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening. We'll have a little post-birhday thing for my little one when they come, just me, the boys and my inlaws. Just some ice cream (he said he prefers it over cake) and a few cartoons. One day at a time.",

      "body": "**Edit: Whoa, I didn't expect this post to get huge. Thanks for all the feedback & opinions, everyone (even the ones who think this is fake. I sincerely hope you never meet someone like Anna in your life).** \n\n**Just some clarifications to clear the air:**\n\n1. **Why did I write this post? I've faced many Anna's in my life, but my comments about how its inappropriate has always been shut down (i.e., you're too sensitive/ they're just trying to be nice/ you're not being welcoming) by others (in other similar situations). It's confusing/ distressing, but I feel like Anna really hit my limit & I wanted to make sure that I'm not TA**\n2. **Is Anna white? She's of mixed heritage (Caucasian & African American). I personally feel like it added another sensitive layer in this entire mix & indirectly goes back to the point above**\n3. **Did I talk to her about this entire thing? I moved out of SEA to get rid of that 'you're not Chinese enough' mentality (I faced that from my own countrymen multiple times) & I don't celebrate Lunar New Year (thanks to those who recommended that term) outside of my home country for personal reasons (my family sucks & I don't have good memories attached to that holiday). I didn't think I would need to justify/ defend myself** ***again.*** **As for the separate incidences, not really (& that's my fault). I just told her don't do that again cause I don't like it. I should have explained to her why, & I accept responsibility for that**\n4. **How did she confuse kabuki masks & think hell notes were decoration? Based on what her bf said, she went to some Chinese website that sells everything & the translation was whacky so she just thought it was all the same**\n5. **The entire organ meat incident: she didn't expect me & SO to eat them raw. She expected SO & I to cook it cause she's seen me cook some herbal soups before (non had organ meat though)**\n\n**Hope that clarifies things for everyone!**\n\nHusband (28M) & I (25F) are ethnically Chinese from a SEA country living overseas. We rent a house with SO's college friend who moved his gf (Anna) in during lockdown & she's been with us ever since (with landlord's permission & she pays her share of bills). They're not Asians, which matters.\n\nAnna was initially nice, but started acting very weirdly a month after she moved in:\n\n1. Telling SO & I that we can practice our 'real' religion (which apparently is Buddhism, not Christianity even though SO & I come from Christian families). She even bought incense (which gives me migraines) & a random Buddha statue. We politely explained to her that we're not Buddhists, but she continued to insist & promised that she didn't mind.\n2. Telling SO & I that we can speak our 'real' language cause she overheard SO's family talking to us in a mix of English & Cantonese. I explained to her that I can't speak Cantonese (SO can) even though I can understand it. She was, for some reason, really disappointed in me & said that I was throwing my heritage away. Plot twist: my own father is only comfortable speaking English.\n3. Buying raw internal organs for SO & I to cook, even though we don't eat those. I told her we don't eat that (not our thing), & she was again disappointed. She told us she read that there were lots of nice recipes & maybe we haven't found the right one to remind us of home. SO told her he's never eaten it ever in his life, & I've never liked it. She was really upset, but had to toss it since no one was gonna eat it\n\nChinese New Year was when things got really really weird. She started ordering 'decorations'. I wouldn't mind, but she had ordered hell notes (the ones burned for deceased ancestors). I immediately told her to stop pasting them all over the walls because they were weirding me out. She ordered banners with SO & my name on it (some bastardisation of our *legal* English names) but they were written on white banners (again, for deceased people). I told her to please take it down. She got upset (again), but then ordered kabuki masks. I told her that those masks were not Chinese, & she just snapped. She started yelling at me that I should be helping her & not critiquing what she was doing. I told her:\n\n1. She never asked\n2. CNY is not a big deal to me, so I wasn't planning on decorating but if she had asked, I would have helped\n3. She never asked\n\nI told her I don't understand her fixation with us. She said she wanted to surprise me & SO, that we've been so 'colonised' we've forgotten our roots, & that we should be embracing our culture. I told her it was a nice gesture, but she needs to stop forcing stereotypes down our throats. She could have just asked & she's not being woke when she's getting everything wrong.\n\nShe burst into tears & brought in her bf. He understood where I was coming from, but thought I could have been nicer. SO stands by me, & now things have been tense, but I've been tolerating this for a while now & it was getting on my nerves.",

      "title": "AITA for pulling my daughter from a waterpark trip because her teacher made her stay with a kid she doesn't like?",
      "body": "My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn’t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I’d think she’s a “bad person.” When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher “Ms. N” has forced her to be the “buddy” of her classmate “Ben” for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n\nI was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn’t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a “behavior buffer” for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It’s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys. \n\nI immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with “if Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben’s buddy.” *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nWhat happened next I wasn’t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn’t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn’t make Bryn do anything she didn’t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job. \n\nMy husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I’ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they’ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn’t Ms. N’s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a \"buddy.\" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.\n\nUPDATE: First, thank you for the support everyone!\n\nSecond, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.",

      "title": "AITA for taking my ex-gf off my insurance policy to force her to give me full custody of my daughter?",
      "body": "Me and my ex gf, Hayley, have one daughter 15F, Elle. \n\nI genuinely don't know if I was right to do what I did. \n\nAround 4 years ago, Hayley had a very bad accident. That ended with her being wheelchair bound. This caused her to develop a lot of resentment towards me. She would get angry if I worked out or played any sports. So, I stopped doing anything physical mostly. We tried counseling for a year and things didn't improve. In the end, we broke up. \n\nEver since Elle was born, I took out a private insurance for me, Elle and Hayley. This helped out a lot when she had her accident. Post break up, I still kept her in my insurance because she couldn't find any work and I knew if I dropped her from the insurance, she wouldn't be able to afford any treatments. \n\nIt's been 2 years since then. We have 50/50 custody, so I don't pay any child support. In the beginning, I kept a very keen eye to make sure that she didn't resent Elle like she resented me. She didn't, so I relaxed. She is still on that insurance because she is not able to find any job except wellfare. I wanted both Hayley and Elle to be well, so I kept the insurance. \n\nHalf a year ago when Elle came to stay, I noticed that  she was very depressed and had gotten very fat compared to before. Nothing overweight. But Elle does ballet and I have never seen her put on that much weight. Turns out Hayley forbade Elle from doing ballet because \"Hayley used to do ballet and Elle is just trying to rub her face in it\". The same for any physical activities like sports or exercising. With the quarantine, it must have been hell to live like that. Elle pretty much broke down and said that for the past few months, things have been escalating to the point that she is scared to walk inside her own house. She just stays in her room and comes out only to eat. Elle just begged me to go to court, so that I can get full custody. \n\nElle is at an age where her opinion matter in court, but it's almost impossible to get 100 percent custody in my state unless I can prove incompetency, according to my lawyer. \n\nSo, I dropped her from the insurance. Elle was supposed to stay with me for the next 6 months. Hayley couldn't get a job. She wiped out her savings as she had to pay for all her treatments. It was getting to the point that she couldn't even afford to get basic things for herself, let alone Elle. \n\nI also applied for sole custody. Given her financial situation and the pandemic and Elle's preference, the judge gave me full custody with supervised visitation for Hayley. Hayley didn't have a good representation at court due to her financial situation. Also, there is a pandemic going on. I left an already vulnerable person without any medical insurance. \n\nI know I did what i had to do to protect my child. But I did so by taking advantage of the medical expenses of a disabled woman. \n\nElle is happy. Hayley obviously thinks I am a manipulative bastard. Everyone seems to have mixed opinions. AITA here? \n\nAlso, dropping her from my insurance was completely legal. I am not from US.",

So my father had a drinking problem most my life until he got liver failure a few years back and they told him if he didn’t stop he would die. After that he just got grumpier to the point that even though I was paying rent for a room in his house he kicked me out by leaving a note on a bag of food the reason given because I wanted to buy an air conditioner to put in my room and that I kept food in the kitchen and used the kitchen to cook. While he got upset that I moved out late because the day I was supposed to move out I ended up going to the hospital. So he charged me another month’s rent just to grab my stuff. Let’s just say that’s the last time I’ve talked to him and it’s been a couple of years. Now a family member is getting married and I’m going to the wedding he is going to be there too but I’m being called an asshole for refusing to talk to him. So WIBTA for going to this wedding to celebrate the couple and still refusing to talk to him even if we are at the same table, my sister and mother seem to think so? ",

      "body": "\ni can’t find anything on any similar situation so i’m sharing mine to see if i’m the asshole.\n\ni am a female (20) my aunt (50). i live with her and i have for a very long time, i stay with her  because it’s closer to my university.\n\nall my life i have also been on the chubbier side, always going up or going down, it never stayed the same. because of this, she has been monitoring what i eat, either letting me eat what she cooks or asking what i ate/what i’m going to eat that day.\n\ni have busy days with working and classes so i order here and there and she’s ALWAYS asking what i ordered and will even go as far telling me to let her see the bag. i’ve struggled with my weight and my mental health when it comes to it for a very long time and i recognize that and i want to get better with that and get to my goal weight and have a better relationship with food.\n\nmy aunt is not good with boundaries and never has been, she’s always coming into my room sitting in my desk chair and talking even when i don’t feel like it, and even telling me i can’t sleep bottomless in my room. i try to brush this off the best i can by just doing what she says because i want to stay here but today really made me upset.\n\ni ordered from a restaurant i always order from with a good ass chicken Caesar salad along with a donut. she has a ring camera so she knows whenever i get something.\n\nwhen my food got here i’m walking to the door and she’s quickly walking to the door as well and i thought she got some food as well, i get my stuff and she’s pestering asking what i got in the bag and “i know it’s something you don’t have any business having.” and i tell her no it’s fine and i’m walking to my room and she’s following me and keeps asking her and i’m telling her “no” holding the bag tightly.\n\nthis goes on for five mintues until i sit down on my bed and she rips the bag from my hand and sees what i have and goes on a lecture about how i need to be eating healthy and that’s why i’m gaining weight, etc.\n\ni understand where she’s coming from, she’s drilled it into my head for many many years but i’m tired. i don’t think this is normal, i’m trying my hardest to work at my speed and have a healthier relationship with food but she wants me to do what SHE wants.\n\ni even confided in her a month ago saying that sometimes it is hard for me to stop eating and she goes on to tell me to just eat once a day and a specific amount of calories because that’s what she does. i texted my mom about this and she agrees what my aunt is doing isn’t normal, i’m just trying to see all sides to this because maybe i’m missing something, maybe there’s something i’m not seeing.\n\ni may be the asshole because i’m always straying away from what she tells me and eat what i want anyway even when she tells me no. \n\nAITA for hiding food from my aunt because she’s always lecturing me?\n",

One day I decided I wanted to have my own account. I felt/ feel that I’m an adult and can have a little bit more financial freedom. I still have my joint account with my mom so that she can still easily transfer money back and forth for bills and such. \n\nI didn’t tell my parents I was going to open another account and I was scared to tell them that I did. And then I forgot to tell them later. I definitely take the blame for their anger on this one. Like yeah they don’t NEED to know but it would’ve been nice to tell them. \n\nAnyways, today my dad got angry because he thinks my bf (that he doesn’t like because he’s mixed) “put me up to it” or my dad thinks I’ve been giving my bf money. Neither assumption is the case. My bf didn’t even know about it nor does he care and he doesn’t need money from me. \n\nI think I’m the asshole because I didn’t tell my parents about the account. ",

      "body": "I (32F) currently live with my husband (37M) in a two floor house in the suburbs that is big enough for both of us and also to house lots of guests if needed. \n\nSeven years ago, when I was 25, I lost my one and only soulmate; my bestfriend. She was my world and my rock and everything made sense around her. I could talk about her all day but that would take too long to write down and I would probably break down in tears anyway;) \nAfter she passed away due to a horrible freak accident, I fell into a depression that led to me drinking away my feelings. This completely altered my life for the worse, I lost my apartment, my friends, my family and my life. I had absolutely no one and my parents were so ashamed of me that they refused to let me live with them. And my sister? She claimed she was living in an apartment that was way too small and that she couldn’t house me. I ended up being hopeless and desperate for a long long time. \n\nSix years and a million AA meetings later, I am now fully sober with a kid on the way:) I never kept contact with my family after what happened, instead I focused on myself and met the love of my life. \nFast forward to a month ago, my sister found my new number via an old friend and contacted me asking if she could stay at my house for awhile. She had lost her job and had been through a tough divorce and lost her house aswell (she had apparently sold the house my parents bought her to live with her partner and later lost the house due to the divorce). Obviously I refused, reminding her of how she treated me in the past.\n\nLast week, my parents& my sister somehow found my address and came to my house demanding to let my sister stay here. \nMy sister defended her past actions by revealing that she found out she was pregnant after my bestfriend passed away but never wanted to tell me due to the fact that I was grieving. She also didn’t want me to stay at her place because she was scared that I would somehow push her into also being an alcoholic and harm her kid. She said that her situation is different now because she already has kids, that her ex-husband has custody of, and that she wants to get her life together and needs my help. After a long discussion things were getting heated and I had to call the police. I am now thinking of filing a restraining order against them but my husband is telling me to “let my rage go” and help my family. I honestly don’t know what to do, I already feel super stressed whilst pregnant and have hormones jumping out of my ears, so that may also be the reason for me being extra angry. I need someones opinion on this situation who doesn’t know me, and I’m hoping for some advice!!\n\nPS: sorry for the super long post, and I also apologise for my english- I am not a native speaker!",

      "title": "AITA for the email I sent to a teacher about her \"You have to include everyone\" rules, saying that was a dangerous lesson?",
      "body": "My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say \"No\" to things she feels uncomfortable with.\n\nThere is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.\n\nMy daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. \n\nHe said no because the teacher had said \"about\" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that \"you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules\" and she said she didn't care. \n\nI heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.\n\nBut then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. \n\nI sent her an email saying..\n\nDear Mrs. (Teacher)\n\nI'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. \n\nShe's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.\n\nI understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.\n\nI think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her \"No\" and stepping out of the situation.\n\nI hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the \"Include everyone\" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say \"No\" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. \n\nThank you,\n\nOP\n\nShe emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh\n\nAITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?\n\n////\n\nEdit to update...\n\nI reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. \n\nI ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. \n\nWe all presented a united front asking for the following...\n\nThe school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be \"nice\". Instead of \"Include everyone\" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nThe school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. \n\nWe went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.\n\nThanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",

      "body": "My boyfriend left me yesterday after a fight, like packed up all of his things minus what didn’t fit in the car and left. So I am under the impression we’re no longer together.\n\nHis sister wanted to throw us a shower as soon as we told her, I was fine with this. I tried to tell her I would prefer a later summer shower so I could prepare and make sure I have what we don’t get as I’m not expecting people to buy us everything we need or want for the baby. Well she chose September for our shower, I will be a few days shy of 37 weeks when the shower takes place which already I didn’t like. I feel like it leaves me no time to prepare for what we didn’t end up getting and honestly I got put on medical leave but didn’t have enough hours to qualify for EI (employment insurance) so I have no income coming in as government assistance keeps rejecting me. I’m living off of credit that I have no idea how I’m going to pay back.\n\nAnyways, now that, in my head at least, we’re not together I don’t feel comfortable attending a party that’s being hosted for us and being surrounded by all his family. I recognize that it’s also my child’s family. I just already wasn’t thrilled about having to go and pretend I’m having fun (if my OB doesn’t put me on bed rest or if he doesn’t come early) when I made it clear that I wanted to be able to enjoy my shower and be in a financially good spot to get what I need. \n\nI don’t want to go to a shower just because I need stuff for the baby, I don’t want to feel indebted to anyone, I don’t know if his sister would even want to throw it for me if we aren’t together, and honestly at this point I’m so close to the end that having to make sure I’m prepared for when baby comes now on my own is too overwhelming and stressful that I don’t even think I have the energy to figure out where me and my ex stand. I now need to figure out who my support person in labour is going to be and I need to figure out how I’m going to get a car seat on my own with my financial situation because I can’t and don’t want to rely on my ex or his family.\n\nSo Reddit, wibtah if I don’t go to my own baby shower?",

      "body": "I 23F am the oldest of three siblings. My parents divorced when I was 6 and both of them moved on. My mom remarried had two kids then divorced again. My dad has a daughter with his current girlfriend. We’re a big mixed family and we actually all get along pretty well. I love my siblings and I help with them a lot. Especially when we have family gatherings. But lately it feels like I’m expected to do everything. My parents only really talk to me when they want something.\n\nNow I’m 3 months pregnant with my fiancé and two weeks ago we had a family gathering. Like usual. I ended up watching all the kids. I didn’t mind much until after dinner. I sat down with a brownie sundae when my little sister (one of my mom’s kids) asked for a bite. I gave her some but then she kept asking for more and I ended up giving her most of it. My fiancé said \"Okay now leave your big sister some\" and my dad responded with something like \"You should realize an older sister is like a second mother and that won’t change even when she has her own kids\" \n\nThat hurt a little. I had really wanted that dessert but I gave it up for my sister anyway. And hearing my dad basically say that I’ll always be expected to take care of everyone even when I have my own baby just hurt. My fiancé tried to brush it off and went to see if there was still some left but my parents gott defensive and started listing all the things an older sister should/expected to do.\n\nI snapped and told them they’ve never really treated me like a daughter. Just someone who’s expected to help out all the time. I immediately regretted it and apologized but my mom grabbed my sister and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the night. My dad didn’t say anything but now he barely responds to my texts. I’m worried I messed up my relationship with my parents and siblings. Did I overreact or how do I fix this?",

I said I can’t attend, because my plane leaves on august 20. She suggested I buy another ticket and refund this, because she’s inviting me month prior and I was supposed to be considerate of her wedding anniversary when I was buying my tickets. My attempt to explain, that I have already another plans past august 20-th with my friends and that I bought tickets on such dates for a reason fell on deaf ear.\n\nNow she’s telling everyone, that I bought tickets before her anniversary on purpose just not to attend and not to congratulate her as I did last year with her delivery date and wedding (about all of those occasions I learnt from my mother weeks after it actually took place)",

      "body": "My Partner (M34) and I (F32) recently welcomed our son Liam Alexander into the world. My partner's sister (Katie) has 2 kids (James 6 and William 4) with her husband (Mike), and he has a daughter (10) with his EX. \n\nMy partner and I didn't settle on a name for our son until the day of his birth. I have always loved the name Liam, for its sound and meaning,  and was over the moon when my partner finally agreed to one of the names on my list.\n24 hours after Liam was born our families came to meet him,  his sister being one of the first. We announced his name to her and her immediate response was \"Oh, I've always loved the name Liam, but Mike wouldn't let me use it for our first son! Could you change it? Maybe call him Alexander as his first name? Its sounds nicer!\" I firmly said I loved the name too, and while I empathise with her, we would not be changing his name, or the order of his names.\n\n I thought that was the end of it until she visited us at home, a week later, and brought it up again. The reason Mike didn't let her use the name is because his EX has a son with that name. I told that shouldn't have stopped her from using the name she loved. Those boys do not know each other, do not go to the same school, don't have the same last name and basically live separate existences outside of their shared half-sister. I also said she could still use the name in future, it's common in my culture and tends to serve as a bond between the kids.\n\nFor clarification, Katie and I have never discussed baby names, and we have no name pacts. \nThe only reason I feel like TA is because Mike and his EX have a toxic coparenting relationship, and this understandably affects Katie. Katie and I have a good relationship but she doesn't talk about Mike's ex, so this is as much as I know. \nAITA?\n\n--\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\nFor privacy, I did not use the real names but, Yes, she did use 'William' as a loophole to get to Liam. She is not trying to name another child.\n The real names are the same name in different languages. They intersect, but are still different enough e.g.  Matthew/ Mateo or José and Joseph. Matthew is Matt and I would call my son Teo for short. So either way, Mike's daughter has two brothers with the same nickname at the very least. \n Sorry for the confusion - my first time posting and post partum brain couldn't think of other names at the time.\n\nMy partner is happy with our name choice, but didn't see 'the big deal' with his sister's request. Which made me think my post partum brain was overreacting and missing something. \nThank you for the compassion and congratulations, this put a smile on my face in light of everything. \n*Still reading through all the comments*",

      "body": "My mom died when I (16m) was 7. She left me an inheritance that my dad was put in charge of. The money was supposed to be for my future and nobody was supposed to touch it unless I really needed it and it was pretty specific. I read through it 5 months ago when shit went down. My dad got married again when I was 10 and he has an 8 year old stepdaughter and now a 4 year old daughter with his wife \"Louise\".\n\nMy half sister was diagnosed with a rare condition when she was 2. It was always clear something was wrong but they had a really hard time figuring out what it was. Doctors would say she'd be fine when she was older. This condition isn't life threatening, like she won't die from it, but it could potentially leave her permanently disabled in a bad way. A few months ago they found out about this hard to get into treatment for it. But it was expensive. There was/is ways to get help paying for it but that takes longer. So my dad decided he would use the inheritance mom left me to pay for it. He tried asking me but he was going to do it anyway and when I said no he told me as much. Then he shamed me for saying no, for putting college before the health of my half sister. Louise was in the room with us but she wasn't talking before I said no. She asked me how I could look at my half sister at the life she will have if we don't do something and say no. I told my dad I would never forgive him if he took the money. After I read her will (grandparents had a copy) I brought up the fact it was only for my needs it could be spent before. He told me mom was dead and he hoped she'd understand. I told him I never would. He told me I'd understand when I'm older. I told him I hated him and I told Louise she better never speak to me again because I found it disgusting she'd encourage stealing from me and taking my mom's money.\n\nI told my grandparents what dad did. They're my mom's parents but had stayed friendly with dad and there were times they would help him. They shared stuff with him all the time and grandpa would look at dad's car for free if anything was wrong. That all stopped when I told them. Dad couldn't figure out why until he confronted them about it last week. They told him he had some nerve stealing from me, taking their daughter's money and spending it on *his* child. My dad was mad they didn't understand and support his decision. He confronted me about it and complained about what I did. I laughed and told him I had warned him I would never forgive him for it. He asked how I got to be so heartless and selfish. I told him I would never forget what he did.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been dating for a few months. I am moving away for university while he is staying in my hometown (he is not from my hometown).\n\nFor a week or two, I’ve been joining various groupchats at my school to reach out and meet new people. I’m very excited to meet new people and potentially make new friends.\n\nHe recently expressed to me that he doesn’t like that I have been following a bunch of people just because they have my school’s name in their bio, specifically guys, but I have just been following everyone, both guys and girls, and asking what their major is or what residence they’re staying in. The convo doesn’t extend beyond that.\n\nHe knows I have a couple friends that are guys (some of whom he’s already iffy about bc he doesn’t like that I’m friends with guys), but doesn’t feel comfortable with me making new guy friends. He told me that he wouldn’t befriend other girls because he wouldn’t want to disrespect me, so me potentially befriending other guys is disrespectful to him and our relationship.\n\nImo, I feel like I should be allowed to make friends with guys, and I wouldn’t stop him from making friends with girls. I understand that a part of this comes from his insecurity with being cheated on, but I don’t think I’m being unreasonable wanting to make new friends for university.\n\nEdit: I do know the title is somewhat misleading, but I wasn’t trying to get flagged by mods 😭 ",

      "body": "Was at the gym doing my usual workout. After transferring machines for a while, I noticed there was an airpod case right beside my phone. Without a doubt, I took it and went home thinking it was mine.\n\nUnfortunately, I was at a work trip so I wasn't aware of it at all until they mentioned it. Told the gym staff that I would return it but it might take a couple of days.\n\nFollowed was a call where the gym staff asked if they could give my number to the person concerned, saying she would file a case of theft because I wouldn't return it. I tried to negotiate but the staff seemed restless so I gave them the go signal. It was unfortunate timing since it was 1pm on a friday so I had work (on top of it being a work trip).\n\nOnce I gave the permission to send over my details to the person concerned, we handled things over a phone call. I repeatedly say unfortunately I have work arrangements at the moment and I can't return the airpods case today. She ignores my words and says three times \"Return it today or else I will file a police report for theft against you\". \n\nObviously this got me a little scared but I really couldnt do much in my current position. I tried to reason with her and she started to become more unreasonable. At this point I figured nothing would be changing and I checked my contact list to see who could go and fetch and return the item for me. Fortunately my dad was available and the remote set up he had at the moment really worked in my favor. \n\nI may have been a little rash, saying \"please keep an eye on your items I thought it was mine and it was on my machine\" which resulted with her shouting \"it was behind me\" on the phone. I knew I shouldnt have said that and I apologized to stop escalating the situation since I am also at fault for taking an item which isn't mine.\n\nSo here I am often thinking about this situation. It certainly doesn't help that my anxiety sky rocketed after that call, but of course I knew I was still at fault. A small part of me wants to hear other people's thoughts and maybe this could get this off my mind. I'm particularly scared about the fact that I do not know who she is, but she knows who I am. So I may or may not be a little anxious going back to the gym I frequently go to. \n",

      "body": "My sister (32F), Olive, has been very demanding and disorganized since getting engaged this past April. At first, she said she never wanted a wedding—just a courthouse marriage. Then she said she was getting married in September. Her plans changed every time we spoke: courthouse, then church and reception, then back to courthouse, then church with 20 guests, and now a church ceremony followed by a banquet hall for 100 people.\n\nShe originally said she didn’t want any events before the wedding. Then out of nowhere, she was having a bridal shower that she claimed her fiancé’s sister would contact me to help plan. No one reached out. Instead, I was sent an invite that was already fully planned by Olive and the sister. I thought it was rude but kept it to myself. The invite instructed guests to send $60 directly to Olive to RSVP. My mom called me saying she had an issue with how Olive was planning, and I agreed—but I always maintained that it was Olive’s wedding and she could do as she pleased.\n\nAbout a month ago, Olive sent out wedding e-invites with an RSVP deadline in August. Less than 24 hours later, she texted me multiple times demanding why my fiancé and I hadn’t RSVP’d. I was confused—why the urgency if the deadline wasn’t for weeks? I asked her, but she read the message and never replied.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my mom called asking why I hadn’t RSVP’d. She said Olive had been ranting that “as my sister, she should be the first to RSVP!! This is bullshit!!” I was frustrated. 1) It was obvious I’d attend. 2) Olive could’ve asked me directly. 3) My fiancé and I were waiting to confirm time off work. My mom also said Olive blamed me for not helping plan the shower. I was angry because I had no contact with the groom’s sister and the shower was already planned without me.\n\nToday, Olive called and texted several times. When I called her back, she said my mom told her I had a problem with the $60 RSVP. I told her I did but also said it’s her wedding and I’d RSVP for the shower when I got paid, and the wedding once we sorted out work. She accused me of giving “weird energy” and not acting like a proper sister. I told her we can’t drop everything for her wedding and that I wasn’t even included in the planning. She said she give a fuck if my fiancé came and that I should’ve RSVP’d right away. When I explained we needed to confirm our work schedules, she said I should just call in sick or not show up. I told her I wasn’t doing that and got upset she’d even suggest it. She started screaming and calling me “fucking stupid,” so I ended the call.\n\nNow, my mom is calling me on three-way with Olive, and I’m refusing to answer. AITA?",

      "body": "  My husband M50 has owned his own business since the mid 90's and it was pretty successful for decades until Covid hit and the economy in our area suffered. (note: There have been downturns in the past where I have picked up the slack but this has now gone on for almost 2 years) As of now it is in the red most months and I have paid his store rent several times. Since there is no profit, I am also paying all the household bills including the mortgage. I have had to ask for money from my parents just so we didn't end up homeless which is embarrassing asf when you are middle aged. At this point it's an expensive hobby not a income and I've told him he should end it. \n\n   He is also overweight (500lbs) and it is effecting his physical/mental wellbeing. It's effecting his job options as well because he can not stand for long periods and walking causes back and leg pain. I have asked him repeatedly to consider help with the weight loss, surgical or shot. He doesn't want to because of possible side effects. I've reminded him that he isn't getting any younger and that at this point diet isn't working. He also isn't exercising enough. I have stated several times over the last couple months that if he doesn't lose weight and get a better paying job that it would be better for me and the kids (16m, 12m, 5f) if we just left. I can't keep watching him refuse to take care of himself until he has a stroke/heart attack and I can't keep being responsible for everything else because he won't change his behavior or situation. AITA for asking him to make a change or I will end the marriage? ",

      "body": "So I am 22F. I don’t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I’m at university. I do however pay my parents about £300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I’m in my final year of uni so I’ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. \n\nI also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it’s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to £100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to £80 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I’ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.\n\nThe only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was “free money.” I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can’t Magic up that kind of money. \n\nThings went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.\n\nWhen I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they’re all trying to take me for a ride and they’re trying to manipulate me cos I’m young and they think I’m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn’t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It’s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument. AITA?",

      "body": "The title sounds awful but please read all the way til the end. DO NOT SPEED READ THIS. \n\nMy (22f)  sister \"Anna\" (21) is \"special need\". She has severe autism and while she is verbal most of her communication is \"physical\" like sign language  due to her social discomfort. She does speak around family though and has pretty bad cognitive skills. She can't comprehend boundaries and lives with our parents so they can best watch her. \n\nI am getting married in 3 months. We planned a simple wedding and reception at my fiance \"Michael's\" parents barn and farm. Since it's all gonna be DIY and we aren't planning anything too expensive,  we can do things pretty quickly since flowers, food and decor will be provided by his family. \n\nI sent out invites last week and I asked that Anna not come. I told my parents I understood that would mean they may not show up but it was just a heads up. Why no Anna? She has an issue with touching Michael and trying to kiss him. At times when we were at my parents house Anna would try and grab Michael's hands, try to lean in to kiss him or would have a really bad shutdowns if she wasn't allowed to be directly next to him. We've tried speaking to her but there's only so much we can do when she doesn't really understand. I told my parents I just want one day for Michael to be *my* partner and not Anna's comfort person. They called me selfish and asked how I expected them to agree to something like this. They told me Anna is disabled and may never experience a wedding of her own and while I have Michael for probably the rest of our lives she'll have no one and that Michael and I can be a little more understanding to the reality of her life. \n\nI feel like a total ass and what they're saying has really gotten to me and I'm starting to question my decision.  AITA?\n\nUpdate: My parents called me letting me know they won't be coming and that it's best I don't bring Michael around anymore since I've \"chosen some man over my sister\". They told me that Anna wanting to kiss Michael and hug him is normal for a women her age and that she doesn't understand what her feelings mean. I suggested they try to redirect her during the wedding but they said Michael is gonna be family to her and he needs to \"get over it\". I suggested they watch the wedding via web and they said that's not fair and that they deserve to see things in person. I asked if *I* could pay for someone with proper credentials to watch her that day while they attention and they asked what I would do when they died and if I'd pawn her off every time. I dropped the unfortunate truth bomb that I don't want to put any more of my life aside for Anna anymore. I did it up until I turned 18. And that Anna is not my life's responsibility and I won't be her keeper. I assured them I'd pay for her care but if she's okay doing this to Michael then I worry for if I ever do choose to have children and what she'd do to them \n They said I was sick for suggesting she'd do anything to my future children and hung up on me. They sent a lengthy text telling me not to contact them until I could \"do the right thing\".  So thts where we are right now.\n\nPLEASE READ: This is NOT an excuse to talk badly about disabled people's nor is this an opportunity to air out your hatred for them. My sister is not a scapegoat to hate disabled people. She is a human being with feelings, she is not a statistic, she is not evil. Please stop treating my sister as if she's a malicious monster, this debacle is between me and my parents. Leave her out of it, please. I am begging you, I don't want to hear why you think my sister sucks.",

However, this has long been a point of contention for two main reasons.\n\n1) Despite also being an adult, my Sister was never required to pay rent by my Mom. This double standard felt incredibly unfair to me;\n\n2) The rent I paid gave me no rights/control whatsoever over my room by her admission, resulting in the incident that led me to stop paying her.\n\nThe incident:\n\nMy grandma was visiting from out of town and my mom decided to move her into my room while I was out despite the fact that, like I said, I work from home most of the time while both Mom and Sister work out of the home. Also important to point out is that I'm autistic, and it's really important to me to be able to work from my room as it's my comfortable, safe space, arranged as I like. My productivity drops like a rock if I'm forced to work from any other place in the house.\n\nI pointed both these facts out to my Mom and concluded that since my Sister's room has a single bed and Granny is a restless sleeper who might fall out, the best solution would be for her to sleep in my Mom's bedroom. Since my Mom and I have nearly identical sleep schedules during the week, we could share my bedroom at night, and she'd be gone in the morning before I started working. \n\nBut she didn't want to. First, because that meant she had to pick her outfits the day before and move them to my bedroom (oh no, what a hassle /s) and then because her, Sister and I would all have to share a bathroom and leave the in-suite bathroom to my grandma (we were currently all sharing the in-suite bathroom because Sister didn't want to share a bathroom with grandma). Then she ran out of excuses and simply said she didn't want to.\n\nI got angry because she wasn't giving me any good reasons so I told her I was going to move granny's things to her bedroom whether she liked it or not because I had an important project and I needed to work. She shot back I had no right to do that because she owned this house, and I answered that I pay for my room so I have a right to it.\n\nMy Mom laughed and said that what I pay is contributions to the household and that she owns my room and can do whatever she pleases with it. I answered that if contributing to the household as her child gave me less rights then a tenant I was not paying anything anymore.\n\nI've stuck with it for two months now but she keeps trying to guilt trip me saying she needs the money for household expenses. But at the same time, she won't charge my Sister anything and I have word from family members that her finances are very well off, she's just paranoid about money.\n\nAITA?\n\nReason I might be the Asshole: She's my mother and owns the house, we have no formal contract, therefore no matter how much I pay I have no inherent right to my room. Plus whether she charges my Sister rent or not is technically none of my business.",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for my brother’s wedding after he kicked me out of the bridal party for getting engaged?",
      "body": "I (41F) have always been close with my brother, “Tom” (38M), and we’ve had a great relationship. When he got engaged to his fiancée “Sarah” (38F), I was honored to be asked to be a bridesmaid. They’ve been planning a big wedding for over a year, and I’ve been heavily involved in helping organize things and even offered to cover some of the costs since my brother and his fiancée were on a tight budget.\n\nA few months ago, my partner proposed (I already refer to him as my husband, but we weren’t officially married) to me, and I said yes! We kept it low-key to not take away from Tom’s upcoming wedding since we have been together for years and have an established marriage like life together. However, after announcing our engagement, Sarah became cold towards me. Tom later told me that Sarah was upset, feeling like I “stole her spotlight” by getting engaged before their wedding.\n\nA week later, Tom and Sarah called me and said that, because of the “timing” of my engagement, it would be “best” if I stepped down as a bridesmaid. Sarah wanted the focus on her, and apparently, my new engagement was “too distracting.” I was hurt but agreed to step down to keep the peace.\n\nHere’s where things escalated: Tom recently asked if I was still willing to help cover the wedding costs I had previously offered to pay for (a significant amount). I was shocked! I politely declined, saying that I didn’t feel comfortable contributing anymore since I was no longer in the bridal party and felt hurt by the situation.\n\nTom got really upset and called me selfish, saying I’m ruining his big day. Sarah even accused me of “holding a grudge” and trying to punish them. Now, my family is split—some think I should still help since I initially offered, while others agree that it’s unfair to expect me to contribute after being kicked out of the wedding party.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to cover the wedding expenses after being removed from the bridal party?",

      "title": "AITA for throwing a gift from my dad's wife in the trash before I moved out of their house?",
      "body": "I (18M) moved out of my dad's house last month, the day I turned 18. I no longer live in the same town and instead I moved in with three of my friends who are starting college next month and I'm about to start trade school. I'm working until trade school starts to afford rent and food. The four of us are splitting the cost between us. I did not take money from my dad. The day I left my dad's wife gave me this photo album, saying it was a growing up gift. This photo album was photos of the 7 years since she and my dad married. I did not appreciate the gift, nor did I want it, which I told her to her face. She told me to take it and I should have family photos when I moved out. Before I left I threw the album into the trash.\n\nTo explain why I did this, what the background is. When I was 10 my mom died. She had an allergic reaction while we were out for a celebratory dinner for my dad and she died on the way to the hospital. Mom was the glue that held us together. Dad and I were never very close before she died. But six weeks later my dad had already met his wife and they boxed up all of my mom's things, clothes, jewelry, photos of her, her phone, keys, anything that was just hers, and they brought it to the dump. I never got anything and neither did any of her family. I was furious and I will never forgive my dad for what he did. The very next day he moved that woman in. They were married 4 months later. Had a small but still an actual formal wedding. They dragged me to it and pretended everything was fine and normal. She even gave a speech about being so excited to have a son of her own and all the \"adventures we'll have together\".\n\nWhen I was 12 I got copies of a couple of photos of mom from extended family and put them in my room. Dad's wife found the photos and she removed them saying I didn't need those and I'd bring everyone down having them in the house. I yelled at her, cursed at her, wished her dead and erased and my dad yelled at me for disrespecting his wife. I told him that day I wish he'd died instead of my mom. He told me he wished he'd let my grandparents take me after the fight they had about mom's stuff going to the dump. I told him I wish he had.\n\nThe 7 years of living with the two of them were hell. I'm so glad I'm gone. I have no respect for either of them and I don't care that my dad lost someone too. He threw her away and not just from him.\n\nAfter I settled in my apartment dad suddenly remembered my number for the first time in three years and called me out for upsetting and disrespecting his wife by throwing her gift away. He told me she did it out of love. I ignored it. She sent me a text on dad's phone telling me I should be surrounded by happy family memories which was why she made the album. I sent a photo of my room which has photos of my mom, ones I got copies of. That was the only reply I made. But I got several more texts, some from an unknown number after I blocked dad saying I was acting spitefully.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA For not inviting my sister to family outings?",
      "body": "AITA for not inviting my older sisters (and their kids) to family outings?\n\nBear with me; this is my first Reddit post. I (19F) come from a big family (8 siblings). Five of them are married, and two of my older sisters, Becky and Rue, each have four kids under the age of nine (so 8 kids total). Right now, most of us (including my brothers, their wives, and the youngest siblings) are all staying at my parents' house for the summer. So a lot of our plans just happen in the moment, based on who’s around and what we feel like doing.\n\nThe drama started last week when we decided to go to Six Flags. I sent a message in the family group chat saying we were planning to go Monday and that anyone who wanted to come could join. One of my sisters (she’s married but doesn’t have kids) joked “no kids allowed,” and Becky and Rue got really upset, accusing us of excluding them. But I had already told them directly (in person) that they could bring their kids. I didn’t understand why they were so upset.\n\nA few days later, we decided last-minute to go see the new Superman movie. I had mentioned it to Becky and Rue earlier in the day, but since they didn’t ask for details or follow up, I bought tickets for myself and the younger siblings. Later, Becky got mad that I didn’t specifically text or call her to tell her we were buying tickets. I tried to explain that I thought I had communicated it, but she said it didn’t count if it wasn’t more direct.\n\nThen my 13-year-old brother made a quick joke, when Becky and Rue were talking about possibly coming saying “aww, don’t bring the kids,” and they both got really angry, yelling at him and me.\n\nThe most recent thing happened yesterday. My sisters-in-law and I went to the mall, and afterward around 7:40, we called Becky and Rue to see if they wanted to grab food. Becky had mentioned earlier that she wanted to go out to eat at 7:00, but I had told her at the time that I wasn’t sure if I could make that. She ended up getting upset that we called “too late,” hung up on me, and was mad again later that we didn’t invite her to the sushi place we went to.\n\nFrom my point of view, it feels like most of the miscommunication is because Becky and Rue aren’t in the house with us, so they’re not really part of the spontaneous conversations or decisions that happen in person. I’m not trying to exclude them, but it’s hard to pause and give a full update every time we do something small. Now I’m starting to wonder—am I actually being inconsiderate?\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate:\nI saw Becky and Rue today at my sister’s birthday. I took the chance to apologize and told them we should go to Hurricane Harbor on Monday; with the kids. I really emphasized how fun it would be for the kids and that I genuinely wanted them to come.\n\nRue said that while she was initially annoyed about the “no kids allowed” comment from our other sister, she understands that since most of us are living in the same house this summer, a lot of plans just happen on the spot and that can make things hard to coordinate. Becky, on the other hand, kind of brushed it off and said she didn’t know if she could come because maybe it’s “no kids allowed.” So… not sure where things stand with her, but I did try to make the effort.",

      "body": "Throwaway.\n\nMy girlfriend, “Rose,” and I have been together for 4 years and she is 5 months pregnant with our first child. My mum seemed to really like Rose (or at the very least tolerated her) - but after we announced that we were expecting, something definitely switched in her. \n\nShe has become extremely rude and disrespectful towards my girlfriend. She makes passive-aggressive comments at every chance she gets. I’ve had to take a step back from my mother until she fixes her behaviour.\n\nRose had gone to visit her family who lives far out of town. It was a very last-minute trip, and she drove herself to the destination and back. Unfortunately, at around 6pm, her car broke down and she was forced to pull over. Fortunately, my brother, “Chris,” who’s great with cars and lives about an hour and ½ from where Rose was stranded, was willing to pick her up and sorted everything out. I was out of the country, so I’m grateful that my brother sorted everything out for her.\n\nChris moved back in with my mum about a year ago. Obviously, the situation wasn’t the best, especially considering the tension between Rose and my mom that exists for no particular reason, but I hoped my mum could put her pettiness aside for at least a night.\n\nIt was too late for Chris to drive Rose back home, so my brother told her that he would drive her back tomorrow morning. An arrangement that my mum seems to not like, but one that she managed to keep her mouth shut about (my girlfriend tells me)\n\nRose helps prepare dinner, wash up, and actually engage in a decent conversation with my mum for the first time in ages. However, they mostly avoid each other. Chris goes to bed earlier, leaving my mum and Rose.\n\nMy mum lives in a two-bedroom apartment and since both bedrooms were taken. Rose assumed that she would be sleeping on the couch.\n\nShe apparently assumed wrong.\n\nMy mum gives Rose the thinnest blanket ever and basically screams at her, telling her that she has to sleep on the floor to not “ruin her couch.” She tells Rose to “make do,” with the pillows on the couch and the blanket that provides zero warmth. \n\nRose thought about protesting, but ultimately decided against it. According to Rose, my mum kept opening her door to check if she was sleeping on the couch, so she couldn’t even try to sleep on the couch.\n\nAt 5am, Chris found Rose on the couch and let her sleep on his bed. He ended up telling me, but told me to not make a “big fuss out of it.”\n\nI did the exact opposite.\n\nI called my mum, very angry, and told her that she was disrespecting her so badly. She tried to defend herself by saying, “that she didn’t harm the baby,” and “it’s okay for pregnant women to sleep on the floor,” but I Refused to hear any of it. Chris agrees with me, but told me that I shouldn’t make it a fight. I feel like I’m losing my mind. AITA?",

She is also pretty self righteous about things like pride, and work ethic, and she just isn't my type of person. I feel bad because I'm her only child and I really wish she had a daughter she could actually enjoy.\n\nMy mom wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, because that's what her friends kids were doing, but I rebelled pretty hard against school. I left home the day I turned 18 and got by through modeling, working at clubs with a fake ID, and dating rich men. She always said I would understand her disappointment when I had daughters, but I have two and I cant imagine being ashamed of something so petty.\n\nI met my husband when I was working as a yacht girl. That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care. I met my husband. he scandalized his entire family by marrying one of *those* girls and we've been very happy for eighteen years. I do have an easy life and I'm not going to lie and say it has nothing to do with looks, but they were my looks to do whatever i want with.\n\nMy mom doesn't like my husband.

Well i met her new husband the other day. He works in finance, nice enough guy, but very straitlaced. He asked how i met my husband and I told him, the true story.\n\nMy mother was furious and I did know she would want me to lie or leave some details out,but it's my story to tell and I'm not ashamed of my life.

My daughter is 14.\n\nJenny is old enough that she stays and goes as she pleases from different parents home. Last summer she was here almost everyday and during the school year she would be at the home 3 times a week.\n\nI have always but good grades on the fridge.  I have done this since my daughter has been tiny. She will still give me grades to put on the fridge especially now that her classes are harder and she is proud how well she did. The most recent one was her chemistry exam. She struggled all year and she got an A on it. She has been very proud of it.\n\nThe issues is my stepdaughter hates this, I have told her if she gets a good grade if she wants we can put it on the fridge.\nToday she ripped down the chemistry test from the fridge and we got into an argument. She wants me to stop putting tests on the fridge since she never has one to put up. I told her no, she is calling me a jerk.\n\nMy husband is also pissed at me and wants me to stop. We also had an argument and I am not going to punish my own child just because she doesn’t get good grades",

I really do appreciate it but growing up he always said that when my sister and I got married we’d each get fifteen thousand dollars to use however we wanted. Whether it was for a big wedding, eloping, saving for a house, it was supposed to be our choice.\n\nMy sister got married a couple years ago and had a big traditional wedding. My dad paid for everything with his credit card and she tracked all the costs in a spreadsheet. It ended up being about fifteen thousand.\n\nNow I’m engaged and my fiancé and I decided we want to elope and keep it super simple so we can save for a house. But now my dad is acting kind of weird about the money. He doesn’t really like the elopement idea and keeps saying we should just use his credit card and track expenses like my sister did.\n\nThe thing is we are not planning to spend anywhere near the full amount. I was hoping he would just give us the money like he always said so we could use it how we want. I get that maybe it feels different for him if he is not directly paying for stuff, but it kind of feels like we only get the full amount if we do things his way…. !? \n\nAm I being a spoiled brat for not wanting to follow the exact same plan my sister did?",

Without going into too many details I recently gained some weight resulting me to go from a s/m to a large and I’ve been struggling with it. My mum have made comments there and there about everything but recently it’s been about my weight and how now some of the dresses that she bought me don’t look as pretty. Tbh I normally would tell her to just leave it and just brush it off. \n\nBut today I just couldn’t. I was preparing some lunch for me and aunt who was visiting us and out of the blue my mum just blurts out how I am getting fat. I don’t know whether it’s just been a bad day or just these comments finally just got to me or simply if she said it to my aunt but I just snapped and just left to my room crying. I could hear my aunt confronting my mum about her comment and then my aunt came to my room stating how my mum is being ridiculous and something about how she just talking about how she just “small” - have no idea what does that refer to. My mum comes in later telling me to go eat and how she was just joking. I told her to leave and that’s when she told me that she will just never joke with me again and how I never act like this and blah blah (tbh I just tuned her out at one point).\n\nAm I being over dramatic? My mum said something about how what she told me was no different to some of the banter that me and my brothers share (stuff like being adopted and other stuff like that) so why am I annoyed about it. But I feel like it’s different hearing that ur fat from your parents compared to ur siblings, joking or not. Also I feel like she wasn’t joking cuz she told me this in the past. Idk I just feel like she playing this stance just because she was confronted. Idk what I want to do but I have just locked myself in my room just doom scrolling.\n\nAITA?",

      "body": "I (F33) just had my birthday last week. The only problem is that no one in my family remembered. \nMy maternal grandfather passed away about a month ago and my entire family (mom, dad, and 2 younger brothers) flew back to my mother’s home country for the funeral. I, unfortunately, could not go as I’ve only recently started a new job. I wasn’t particularly close to my grandfather so I wasn’t too upset about staying behind. \nMy family was gone for a total of 22 days and we FaceTimed and stayed in constant communication during their trip. I think it’s great that my mom got to reconnect with family and that my brothers got a chance to meet everyone. They got back last Wednesday and have been readjusting due to jet lag since then (understandably). \nMy birthday was last Friday (2 days) after they got back. TBH, I wasn’t expecting more than birthday wishes from everyone, but the day past without a word from anyone. Was I annoyed? Sure. But I wasn’t too upset. I’m not the biggest birthday person. I ended up having a nice birthday dinner with my boyfriend and a few friends. \nAll hell broke loose Saturday afternoon when I got a really angry phone call from my dad. I guess my boyfriend did a special IG post for me and my brothers saw it and showed my parents. I had no idea he did this as he isn’t a big poster. Anyway, I could hear my mom crying in the background while my dad laid into me saying that they were sorry they forgot, but not saying anything and then posting about it online was passive aggressive and mean. I told him that I wasn’t upset and that I didn’t think a 33rd birthday was that big a deal anyway. He said a few more things before abruptly ending the call. I didn’t hear from my family the rest of the weekend. \nToday (Monday) I woke up to a bunch of notifications. I guess my mom did a Facebook post talking about ungrateful kids and how I ruined their surprise party for me and tagged me. My extended family seemed to agree that I was a jerk. I’ve tried calling my mom, but she didn’t answer so I posted my own reply and said “You guys forgot and no one wished me a happy birthday unless you count dad calling and yelling at me”. Both of my parents have been calling all morning, but I don’t want to take their calls yet. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I couldn’t post the update to this sub since it’s a bit long, but you can find it in my profile. Thank you for the birthday wishes!",

I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming.\n\n\nMIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed.\n\nlast night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer.\n\nI got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her.\n\n\nHe came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying \"shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?\" then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.\nAITA for not asking her nicely like my husband wanted?\n\nEdit; some mistakes because my hands are a bit unsteady.",

He says \"I dont need to\" or \"just fucking drop it\". \n   My mother sat us down and had a talk with us about the money. She told me until my brother \"finds himself\" I have to be a good brother and pick up his slack. I said \"fuck no. Its not my fault hes a loser who sits on his ass all day\" (for context. I spend all may days off cooking and cleaning when he literally has no chores and refuses to clean). Now my brother is crying and im being called a bad brother when I refused to pick up his slack.

She never brought it up again. It's not like she doesn't have any kids of her own.   \nShe has 1 daughter who was in a different state for college when they got married. I never met her. Only knew her name. Dad invited me over for dinner to meet her once she was back. She's like a few years older than me.   \nLet's call her Stella.   \nDinner was okay-ish. I kept to myself mostly since I really didn't know how to initiate conversation tbh. So yeah...Stella and I BARELY talked.   \nSurprisingly though, a few days later, I get a call from Brittany. She told me that Stella wanted to move out and find herself an apartment.   \nI thought she was asking me to help Stella look for apartments. Before I could even say that I was happy to help, Brittany asked if Stella could move in with me. \n\nIn any other circumstances, I would've agreed.   \nBut my fiancé will be moving in with me soon and my apartment has only 2 rooms. The second one will be turned into a Nursery.   \nI told Brittany that I would help Stella find an apartment but moving in with me would be difficult. \n\nShe started a huge drama. She involved my dad. And my dad's like \"Don't be selfish. You have 2 rooms. Give one to your Stella\" blah blah blah.   \nI think the only reason Stella was so adamant on moving in with me is to avoid rent. Mostly because she's shying away from 30 and still unemployed.   \nBut honestly, I can't accommodate someone else.\n\nI told them how my fiancé and I were planning to start a family. Brittany said \"so what, 3 of you can fit in a room\"\n\nActually no. With a dresser, bed and wardrobe, we can't accommodate a crib in there. Last straw was when dad said   \n\"You don't do that to your sister. She's family.\" I snapped. \n\n\"No. She is not my sister. And Brittany is not my mother, no matter how much you force it on me.\" There...I said it to their faces. Idk why they get offended after hearing the truth.  \nThey all were offended. I'll miss my dad. Especially since he has now cut contact with me. and the last message he sent was \n\n\"Can't believe a selfish, spoiled brat was a product of me\" ",

      "body": "Hi Reddit. I’m a 19-year-old F college student, currently majoring in nursing. My dad 38 M is in prison for money laundering, and ever since he’s been incarcerated, he’s been asking me to do things that I’m just not comfortable with. Some of these things started before he even went in.\n\nFor example, he asked me to take care of one of my younger brothers (half-brother) who just turned 10 I say half- brother so you can understand we have different mothers I love him deeply, but the 10-year-old’s mom isn’t the most attentive parent. He often isn’t clean, has untreated eczema that’s so bad he scratches himself into sores, and generally looks unkept. It’s sad and upsetting to see, because I didn’t experience any of this as a child and I he doesn’t deserve that. My dad told me I should call her and “make sure she’s doing right by him.” I told him no, that it’s not my place. She’s a grown woman and that’s her child. Trying to call her and tell her what to do would likely come off as judgmental or cause tension, especially since she and my mom have had altercations in the past. I don’t want to get in the middle of that drama or risk making the situation worse.\n\nHe got mad that I wouldn’t call her, but that’s just one example. More recently, he’s been pressuring me to create a PayPal account using my name and credit so he can send money out. I’ve told him I’m not comfortable with that either, especially because he’s literally in prison for money laundering. I’m a student taking out loans, and I have to protect my credit and name. When I refused, he got upset and accused me of not helping the family.\n\nHe also expects me to drive home every weekend (I live about 2 hours away) to basically co-parent my little brother — take him out, be with him, spend the weekend like I’m his fun guardian. But I’m in college full time with a demanding major. It’s just not realistic for me to give up every weekend like that, mentally, physically, or financially.\n\nThere’s a pattern: when I say “no,” he either guilt-trips me or acts like I’m letting the whole family down. It’s taking a toll on me, and I’m starting to feel like I’m being used more than I’m being supported.\n\nSo… AITA for setting these boundaries and refusing to do what he asks?\n\n",
